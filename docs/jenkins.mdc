This section builds on the information introduced in [Getting started with Pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started) and should be treated solely as a reference.
For more information on how to use Pipeline syntax in practical examples, refer to the [Using a Jenkinsfile](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile) section of this chapter.
As of version 2.5 of the Pipeline plugin, Pipeline supports two discrete syntaxes which are detailed below.
For the pros and cons of each, refer to the [Syntax Comparison](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#compare).

As discussed at the [start of this chapter](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/), the most fundamental part of a Pipeline is the "step". Basically, steps tell Jenkins _what_ to do and serve as the basic building block for both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline syntax.

For an overview of available steps, please refer to the [Pipeline Steps reference](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps) which contains a comprehensive list of steps built into Pipeline as well as steps provided by plugins.

## Declarative Pipeline [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#declarative-pipeline)

Declarative Pipeline presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems.
In order to use them, install the [Pipeline: Declarative Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-model-definition).

All valid Declarative Pipelines must be enclosed within a `pipeline` block, for example:

```
pipeline {
    /* insert Declarative Pipeline here */
}
```

groovyCopied!

The basic statements and expressions which are valid in Declarative Pipeline follow the same rules as [Groovy’s syntax](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html) with the following exceptions:

- The top-level of the Pipeline must be a _block_, specifically: `pipeline { }`.

- No semicolons as statement separators.
Each statement has to be on its own line.

- Blocks must only consist of [Sections](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-sections), [Directives](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-directives), [Steps](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-steps), or assignment statements.

- A property reference statement is treated as a no-argument method invocation.
So, for example, `input` is treated as `input()`.


You can use the [Declarative Directive Generator](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#directive-generator) to help you get started with configuring the directives and sections in your Declarative Pipeline.

### Limitations [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#limitations)

There is currently an [open issue](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-37984) which limits the maximum size of the code within the `pipeline{}` block.
This limitation does not apply to Scripted Pipelines.

### Sections [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#declarative-sections)

Sections in Declarative Pipeline typically contain one or more [Directives](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-directives) or [Steps](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-steps).

#### agent [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#agent)

The `agent` section specifies where the entire Pipeline, or a specific stage, will execute in the Jenkins environment depending on where the `agent` section is placed.
The section must be defined at the top-level inside the `pipeline` block, but stage-level usage is optional.

| Required | Yes |
| Parameters | [Described below](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#agent-parameters) |
| Allowed | In the top-level `pipeline` block and each `stage` block. |

##### Differences between top level agents and stage level agents [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#differences-between-top-and-stage-level)

There are some nuances when adding an agent to the top level or a stage level when the `options` directive is applied.
Check the section [options](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#options) for more information.

###### Top Level Agents [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#top-level-agents)

In `agents` declared at the top level of a Pipeline, an agent is allocated and then the `timeout` option is applied.
The time to allocate the agent **is not included** in the limit set by the `timeout` option.

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        // Timeout counter starts AFTER agent is allocated
        timeout(time: 1, unit: 'SECONDS')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

###### Stage Agents [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#stage-level-agents)

In `agents` declared within a stage, the options are invoked **before** allocating the `agent` and **before** checking any `when` conditions.
In this case, when using `timeout`, it is applied **before** the `agent` is allocated.
The time to allocate the agent **is included** in the limit set by the `timeout` option.

```
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            agent any
            options {
                // Timeout counter starts BEFORE agent is allocated
                timeout(time: 1, unit: 'SECONDS')
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

This timeout will include the agent provisioning time.
Because the timeout includes the agent provisioning time, the Pipeline may fail in cases where agent allocation is delayed.

##### Parameters [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#agent-parameters)

In order to support the wide variety of use-cases Pipeline authors may have, the `agent` section supports a few different types of parameters.
These parameters can be applied at the top-level of the `pipeline` block, or within each `stage` directive.

any

Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on any available agent.
For example: `agent any`

none

When applied at the top-level of the `pipeline` block no global agent will be allocated for the entire Pipeline run and each `stage` section will need to contain its own `agent` section.
For example: `agent none`

label

Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on an agent available in the Jenkins environment with the provided label.
For example: `agent { label 'my-defined-label' }`

Label conditions can also be used:
For example: `agent { label 'my-label1 && my-label2' }` or `agent { label 'my-label1 || my-label2' }`

node

`agent { node { label 'labelName' } }` behaves the same as `agent { label 'labelName' }`, but `node` allows for additional options (such as `customWorkspace`).

docker

Execute the Pipeline, or stage, with the given container which will be dynamically provisioned on a [node](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/#node) pre-configured to accept Docker-based Pipelines, or on a node matching the optionally defined `label` parameter.
`docker` also optionally accepts an `args` parameter which may contain arguments to pass directly to a `docker run` invocation, and an `alwaysPull` option, which will force a `docker pull` even if the image name is already present.
For example: `agent { docker 'maven:3.9.3-eclipse-temurin-17' }` or

```
agent {
    docker {
        image 'maven:3.9.3-eclipse-temurin-17'
        label 'my-defined-label'
        args  '-v /tmp:/tmp'
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

`docker` also optionally accepts a `registryUrl` and `registryCredentialsId` parameters which will help to specify the Docker Registry to use and its credentials.
The parameter `registryCredentialsId` could be used alone for private repositories within the docker hub.
For example:

```
agent {
    docker {
        image 'myregistry.com/node'
        label 'my-defined-label'
        registryUrl 'https://myregistry.com/'
        registryCredentialsId 'myPredefinedCredentialsInJenkins'
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

dockerfile

Execute the Pipeline, or stage, with a container built from a `Dockerfile` contained in the source repository.
In order to use this option, the `Jenkinsfile` must be loaded from either a **Multibranch Pipeline** or a **Pipeline from SCM**.
Conventionally this is the `Dockerfile` in the root of the source repository: `agent { dockerfile true }`.
If building a `Dockerfile` in another directory, use the `dir` option: `agent { dockerfile { dir 'someSubDir' } }`.
If your `Dockerfile` has another name, you can specify the file name with the `filename` option. You can pass additional arguments to the `docker build …​` command with the `additionalBuildArgs` option, like `agent { dockerfile { additionalBuildArgs '--build-arg foo=bar' } }`.
For example, a repository with the file `build/Dockerfile.build`, expecting a build argument `version`:

```
agent {
    // Equivalent to "docker build -f Dockerfile.build --build-arg version=1.0.2 ./build/
    dockerfile {
        filename 'Dockerfile.build'
        dir 'build'
        label 'my-defined-label'
        additionalBuildArgs  '--build-arg version=1.0.2'
        args '-v /tmp:/tmp'
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

`dockerfile` also optionally accepts a `registryUrl` and `registryCredentialsId` parameters which will help to specify the Docker Registry to use and its credentials.
For example:

```
agent {
    dockerfile {
        filename 'Dockerfile.build'
        dir 'build'
        label 'my-defined-label'
        registryUrl 'https://myregistry.com/'
        registryCredentialsId 'myPredefinedCredentialsInJenkins'
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

kubernetes

Execute the Pipeline, or stage, inside a pod deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.
In order to use this option, the `Jenkinsfile` must be loaded from either a **Multibranch Pipeline** or a **Pipeline from SCM**.
The Pod template is defined inside the kubernetes { } block.
For example, if you want a pod with a Kaniko container inside it, you would define it as follows:

```
agent {
    kubernetes {
        defaultContainer 'kaniko'
        yaml '''
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kaniko
    image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:debug
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    command:
    - sleep
    args:
    - 99d
    volumeMounts:
      - name: aws-secret
        mountPath: /root/.aws/
      - name: docker-registry-config
        mountPath: /kaniko/.docker
  volumes:
    - name: aws-secret
      secret:
        secretName: aws-secret
    - name: docker-registry-config
      configMap:
        name: docker-registry-config
'''
   }
```

groovyCopied!

You will need to create a secret `aws-secret` for Kaniko to be able to authenticate with ECR.
This secret should contain the contents of `~/.aws/credentials`.
The other volume is a ConfigMap which should contain the endpoint of your ECR registry.
For example:

```
{
      "credHelpers": {
        "<your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com": "ecr-login"
      }
}
```

Refer to the following example for reference: [https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin/blob/master/examples/kaniko.groovy](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin/blob/master/examples/kaniko.groovy)

##### Common Options [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#common-options)

These are a few options that can be applied to two or more `agent` implementations.
They are not required unless explicitly stated.

label

A string.
The label or label condition on which to run the Pipeline or individual `stage`.

This option is valid for `node`, `docker`, and `dockerfile`, and is required for `node`.

customWorkspace

A string.
Run the Pipeline or individual `stage` this `agent` is applied to within this custom workspace, rather than the default.
It can be either a relative path, in which case the custom workspace will be under the workspace root on the node, or an absolute path.
For example:

```
agent {
    node {
        label 'my-defined-label'
        customWorkspace '/some/other/path'
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

This option is valid for `node`, `docker`, and `dockerfile`.

reuseNode

A boolean, false by default.
If true, run the container on the node specified at the top-level of the Pipeline, in the same workspace, rather than on a new node entirely.

This option is valid for `docker` and `dockerfile`, and only has an effect when used on an `agent` for an individual `stage`.

args

A string.
Runtime arguments to pass to `docker run`.

This option is valid for `docker` and `dockerfile`.

Example 1. Docker Agent, Declarative Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent { docker 'maven:3.9.3-eclipse-temurin-17' } (1)
    stages {
        stage('Example Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B clean verify'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Execute all the steps defined in this Pipeline within a newly created container of the given name and tag ( `maven:3.9.3-eclipse-temurin-17`). |

Example 2. Stage-level Agent Section

```
pipeline {
    agent none (1)
    stages {
        stage('Example Build') {
            agent { docker 'maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-21' } (2)
            steps {
                echo 'Hello, Maven'
                sh 'mvn --version'
            }
        }
        stage('Example Test') {
            agent { docker 'openjdk:21-jre' } (3)
            steps {
                echo 'Hello, JDK'
                sh 'java -version'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| **1** | Defining `agent none` at the top-level of the Pipeline ensures that [an Executor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/#executor) will not be assigned unnecessarily.<br>Using `agent none` also forces each `stage` section to contain its own `agent` section. |
| **2** | Execute the steps in this stage in a newly created container using this image. |
| **3** | Execute the steps in this stage in a newly created container using a different image from the previous stage. |

#### post [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#post)

The `post` section defines one or more additional [steps](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-steps) that are run upon the completion of a Pipeline’s or stage’s run (depending on the location of the `post` section within the Pipeline). `post` can support any of the following [post-condition](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post-conditions) blocks: `always`, `changed`, `fixed`, `regression`, `aborted`, `failure`, `success`, `unstable`, `unsuccessful`, and `cleanup`.
These condition blocks allow the execution of steps inside each condition depending on the completion status of the Pipeline or stage.
The condition blocks are executed in the order shown below.

| Required | No |
| Parameters | _None_ |
| Allowed | In the top-level `pipeline` block and each `stage` block. |

##### Conditions [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#post-conditions)

`always`

Run the steps in the `post` section regardless of the completion status of the Pipeline’s or stage’s run.

`changed`

Only run the steps in `post` if the current Pipeline’s run has a different completion status from its previous run.

`fixed`

Only run the steps in `post` if the current Pipeline’s run is successful and the previous run failed or was unstable.

`regression`

Only run the steps in `post` if the current Pipeline’s or status is failure, unstable, or aborted and the previous run was successful.

`aborted`

Only run the steps in `post` if the current Pipeline’s run has an "aborted" status, usually due to the Pipeline being manually aborted.
This is typically denoted by gray in the web UI.

`failure`

Only run the steps in `post` if the current Pipeline’s or stage’s run has a "failed" status, typically denoted by red in the web UI.

`success`

Only run the steps in `post` if the current Pipeline’s or stage’s run has a "success" status, typically denoted by blue or green in the web UI.

`unstable`

Only run the steps in `post` if the current Pipeline’s run has an "unstable" status, usually caused by test failures, code violations, etc.
This is typically denoted by yellow in the web UI.

`unsuccessful`

Only run the steps in `post` if the current Pipeline’s or stage’s run has not a "success" status.
This is typically denoted in the web UI depending on the status previously mentioned (for stages this may fire if the build itself is unstable).

`cleanup`

Run the steps in this `post` condition after every other `post` condition has been evaluated, regardless of the Pipeline or stage’s status.

Example 3. Post Section, Declarative Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
    post { (1)
        always { (2)
            echo 'I will always say Hello again!'
        }
    }
}
```

| **1** | Conventionally, the `post` section should be placed at the end of the Pipeline. |
| **2** | [Post-condition](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post-conditions) blocks contain [steps](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-steps) the same as the [steps](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps) section. |

#### stages [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#stages)

Containing a sequence of one or more [stage](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage) directives, the `stages` section is where the bulk of the "work" described by a Pipeline will be located.
At a minimum, it is recommended that `stages` contain at least one [stage](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage) directive for each discrete part of the continuous delivery process, such as Build, Test, and Deploy.

| Required | Yes |
| Parameters | _None_ |
| Allowed | Inside the `pipeline` block, or within a `stage`. |

Example 4. Stages, Declarative Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages { (1)
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| **1** | The `stages` section will typically follow the directives such as `agent`, `options`, etc. |

#### steps [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#steps)

The `steps` section defines a series of one or more [steps](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-steps) to be executed in a given `stage` directive.

### Directives [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#declarative-directives)

#### environment [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#environment)

The `environment` directive specifies a sequence of key-value pairs which will be defined as environment variables for all steps, or stage-specific steps, depending on where the `environment` directive is located within the Pipeline.

This directive supports a special helper method `credentials()` which can be used to access pre-defined Credentials by their identifier in the Jenkins environment.

| Required | No |
| Parameters | _None_ |
| Allowed | Inside the `pipeline` block, or within `stage` directives. |

##### Supported Credentials Type [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#supported-credentials-type)

Secret Text

The environment variable specified will be set to the Secret Text content.

Secret File

The environment variable specified will be set to the location of the File file that is temporarily created.

Username and password

The environment variable specified will be set to `username:password` and two additional environment variables will be automatically defined: `MYVARNAME_USR` and `MYVARNAME_PSW` respectively.

SSH with Private Key

The environment variable specified will be set to the location of the SSH key file that is temporarily created and two additional environment variables will be automatically defined: `MYVARNAME_USR` and `MYVARNAME_PSW` (holding the passphrase).

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | Unsupported credentials type causes the pipeline to fail with the message: `org.jenkinsci.plugins.credentialsbinding.impl.CredentialNotFoundException: No suitable binding handler could be found for type <unsupportedType>.` |

Example 6. Secret Text Credentials, Declarative Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment { (1)
        CC = 'clang'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            environment { (2)
                AN_ACCESS_KEY = credentials('my-predefined-secret-text') (3)
            }
            steps {
                sh 'printenv'

#### options [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#options)

The `options` directive allows configuring Pipeline-specific options from within the Pipeline itself.
Pipeline provides a number of these options, such as `buildDiscarder`, but they may also be provided by plugins, such as `timestamps`.

| Required | No |
| Parameters | _None_ |
| Allowed | Inside the `pipeline` block, or (with certain limitations) within `stage` directives. |

##### Available Options [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#available-options)

buildDiscarder

Persist artifacts and console output for the specific number of recent Pipeline runs.
For example: `options { buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '1')) }`

checkoutToSubdirectory

Perform the automatic source control checkout in a subdirectory of the workspace.
For example: `options { checkoutToSubdirectory('foo') }`

disableConcurrentBuilds

Disallow concurrent executions of the Pipeline.
Can be useful for preventing simultaneous accesses to shared resources, etc.
For example: `options { disableConcurrentBuilds() }` to queue a build when there’s already an executing build of the Pipeline, or `options { disableConcurrentBuilds(abortPrevious: true) }` to abort the running one and start the new build.

disableResume

Do not allow the pipeline to resume if the controller restarts.
For example: `options { disableResume() }`

newContainerPerStage

Used with `docker` or `dockerfile` top-level agent.
When specified, each stage will run in a new container deployed on the same node, rather than all stages running in the same container deployment.

overrideIndexTriggers

Allows overriding default treatment of branch indexing triggers.
If branch indexing triggers are disabled at the multibranch or organization label, `options { overrideIndexTriggers(true) }` will enable them for this job only.
Otherwise, `options { overrideIndexTriggers(false) }` will disable branch indexing triggers for this job only.

preserveStashes

Preserve stashes from completed builds, for use with stage restarting.
For example: `options { preserveStashes() }` to preserve the stashes from the most recent completed build, or `options { preserveStashes(buildCount: 5) }` to preserve the stashes from the five most recent completed builds.

quietPeriod

Set the quiet period, in seconds, for the Pipeline, overriding the global default.
For example: `options { quietPeriod(30) }`

retry

On failure, retry the entire Pipeline the specified number of times.
For example: `options { retry(3) }`

skipDefaultCheckout

Skip checking out code from source control by default in the `agent` directive.
For example: `options { skipDefaultCheckout() }`

skipStagesAfterUnstable

Skip stages once the build status has gone to UNSTABLE.
For example: `options { skipStagesAfterUnstable() }`

timeout

Set a timeout period for the Pipeline run, after which Jenkins should abort the Pipeline.
For example: `options { timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') }`

Example 8. Global Timeout, Declarative Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') (1)
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

timestamps

Prepend all console output generated by the Pipeline run with the time at which the line was emitted.
For example: `options { timestamps() }`

parallelsAlwaysFailFast

Set failfast true for all subsequent parallel stages in the pipeline.
For example: `options { parallelsAlwaysFailFast() }`

disableRestartFromStage

Completely disable option "Restart From Stage" visible in classic Jenkins UI and Blue Ocean as well.
For example: `options { disableRestartFromStage() }`.
This option can not be used inside of the stage.

##### stage options [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#stage-options)

The `options` directive for a `stage` is similar to the `options` directive at the root of the Pipeline.
However, the `stage`-level `options` can only contain steps like `retry`, `timeout`, or `timestamps`, or Declarative options that are relevant to a `stage`, like `skipDefaultCheckout`.

Inside a `stage`, the steps in the `options` directive are invoked before entering the `agent` or checking any `when` conditions.

###### Available Stage Options [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#available-stage-options)

skipDefaultCheckout

Skip checking out code from source control by default in the `agent` directive.
For example: `options { skipDefaultCheckout() }`

timeout

Set a timeout period for this stage, after which Jenkins should abort the stage.
For example: `options { timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') }`

Example 9. Stage Timeout, Declarative Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            options {
                timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') (1)
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}

retry

On failure, retry this stage the specified number of times.
For example: `options { retry(3) }`

timestamps

Prepend all console output generated during this stage with the time at which the line was emitted.
For example: `options { timestamps() }`

#### parameters [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#parameters)

The `parameters` directive provides a list of parameters that a user should provide when triggering the Pipeline.
The values for these user-specified parameters are made available to Pipeline steps via the `params` object, refer to the [Parameters, Declarative Pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#parameters-example) for its specific usage.

Each parameter has a _Name_ and _Value_, depending on the parameter type.
This information is exported as environment variables when the build starts, allowing subsequent parts of the build configuration to access those values.
For example, use the `${PARAMETER_NAME}` syntax with POSIX shells like `bash` and `ksh`, the `${Env:PARAMETER_NAME}` syntax with PowerShell, or the `%PARAMETER_NAME%` syntax with Windows `cmd.exe`.

| Required | No |
| Parameters | _None_ |
| Allowed | Only once, inside the `pipeline` block. |

##### Available Parameters [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#available-parameters)

string

A parameter of a string type, for example: `parameters { string(name: 'DEPLOY_ENV', defaultValue: 'staging', description: '') }`.

text

A text parameter, which can contain multiple lines, for example: `parameters { text(name: 'DEPLOY_TEXT', defaultValue: 'One\nTwo\nThree\n', description: '') }`.

booleanParam

A boolean parameter, for example: `parameters { booleanParam(name: 'DEBUG_BUILD', defaultValue: true, description: '') }`.

choice

A choice parameter, for example: `parameters { choice(name: 'CHOICES', choices: ['one', 'two', 'three'], description: '') }`.
The first value is the default.

password

A password parameter, for example: `parameters { password(name: 'PASSWORD', defaultValue: 'SECRET', description: 'A secret password') }`.

Example 10. Parameters, Declarative Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'PERSON', defaultValue: 'Mr Jenkins', description: 'Who should I say hello to?')

        text(name: 'BIOGRAPHY', defaultValue: '', description: 'Enter some information about the person')

        booleanParam(name: 'TOGGLE', defaultValue: true, description: 'Toggle this value')

        choice(name: 'CHOICE', choices: ['One', 'Two', 'Three'], description: 'Pick something')

        password(name: 'PASSWORD', defaultValue: 'SECRET', description: 'Enter a password')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo "Hello ${params.PERSON}"

                echo "Biography: ${params.BIOGRAPHY}"

                echo "Toggle: ${params.TOGGLE}"

                echo "Choice: ${params.CHOICE}"

                echo "Password: ${params.PASSWORD}"

#### triggers [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#triggers)

The `triggers` directive defines the automated ways in which the Pipeline should be re-triggered.
For Pipelines which are integrated with a source such as GitHub or BitBucket, `triggers` may not be necessary as webhooks-based integration will likely already be present.
The triggers currently available are `cron`, `pollSCM` and `upstream`.

| Required | No |
| Parameters | _None_ |
| Allowed | Only once, inside the `pipeline` block. |

cron

Accepts a cron-style string to define a regular interval at which the Pipeline should be re-triggered, for example: `triggers { cron('H */4 * * 1-5') }`.

pollSCM

Accepts a cron-style string to define a regular interval at which Jenkins should check for new source changes.
If new changes exist, the Pipeline will be re-triggered.
For example: `triggers { pollSCM('H */4 * * 1-5') }`

upstream

Accepts a comma-separated string of jobs and a threshold.
When any job in the string finishes with the minimum threshold, the Pipeline will be re-triggered.
For example: `triggers { upstream(upstreamProjects: 'job1,job2', threshold: hudson.model.Result.SUCCESS) }`

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | The `pollSCM` trigger is only available in Jenkins 2.22 or later. |

Example 11. Triggers, Declarative Pipeline

```
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    triggers {
        cron('H */4 * * 1-5')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }

#### Jenkins cron syntax [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#cron-syntax)

The Jenkins cron syntax follows the syntax of the [cron utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) (with minor differences).
Specifically, each line consists of 5 fields separated by TAB or whitespace:

| MINUTE | HOUR | DOM | MONTH | DOW |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Minutes within the hour (0–59) | The hour of the day (0–23) | The day of the month (1–31) | The month (1–12) | The day of the week (0–7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday. |

To specify multiple values for one field, the following operators are available.
In the order of precedence,

- `*` specifies all valid values

- `M-N` specifies a range of values

- `M-N/X` or `*/X` steps by intervals of `X` through the specified range or whole valid range

- `A,B,…​,Z` enumerates multiple values


To allow periodically scheduled tasks to produce even load on the system, the symbol `H` (for “hash”) should be used wherever possible.
For example, using `0 0 * * *` for a dozen daily jobs will cause a large spike at midnight.
In contrast, using `H H * * *` would still execute each job once a day, but not all at the same time, better using limited resources.

The `H` symbol can be used with a range.
For example, `H H(0-7) * * *` means some time between 12:00 AM (midnight) to 7:59 AM.
You can also use step intervals with `H`, with or without ranges.

The `H` symbol can be thought of as a random value over a range, but it actually is a hash of the job name, not a random function, so that the value remains stable for any given project.

Beware that for the day of month field, short cycles such as `*/3` or `H/3` will not work consistently near the end of most months, due to variable month lengths.
For example, `*/3` will run on the 1st, 4th, …31st days of a long month, then again the next day of the next month.
Hashes are always chosen in the 1-28 range, so `H/3` will produce a gap between runs of between 3 and 6 days at the end of a month.
Longer cycles will also have inconsistent lengths, but the effect may be relatively less noticeable.

Empty lines and lines that start with `#` will be ignored as comments.

In addition, `@yearly`, `@annually`, `@monthly`, `@weekly`, `@daily`, `@midnight`, and `@hourly` are supported as convenient aliases.
These use the hash system for automatic balancing.
For example, `@hourly` is the same as `H * * * *` and could mean at any time during the hour.
`@midnight` actually means some time between 12:00 AM and 2:59 AM.

|     |
| --- |
| every fifteen minutes (perhaps at :07, :22, :37, :52) |
| `triggers{ cron('H/15 * * * *') }` |
| every ten minutes in the first half of every hour (three times, perhaps at :04, :14, :24) |
| `triggers{ cron('H(0-29)/10 * * * *') }` |
| once every two hours at 45 minutes past the hour starting at 9:45 AM and finishing at 3:45 PM every weekday. |
| `triggers{ cron('45 9-16/2 * * 1-5') }` |
| once in every two hours slot between 9 AM and 5 PM every weekday (perhaps at 10:38 AM, 12:38 PM, 2:38 PM, 4:38 PM) |
| `triggers{ cron('H H(9-16)/2 * * 1-5') }` |
| once a day on the 1st and 15th of every month except December |
| `triggers{ cron('H H 1,15 1-11 *') }` |

#### stage [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#stage)

The `stage` directive goes in the `stages` section and should contain a [steps](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps) section, an optional `agent` section, or other stage-specific directives.
Practically speaking, all of the real work done by a Pipeline will be wrapped in one or more `stage` directives.

| Required | At least one |
| Parameters | One mandatory parameter, a string for the name of the stage. |
| Allowed | Inside the `stages` section. |

Example 12. Stage, Declarative Pipeline

```
// Declarative //
pipeline {

#### input [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#input)

The `input` directive on a `stage` allows you to prompt for input, using the [`input` step](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/pipeline-input-step/#input-wait-for-interactive-input).
The `stage` will pause after any `options` have been applied, and before entering the `agent` block for that `stage` or evaluating the `when` condition of the `stage`.
If the `input` is approved, the `stage` will then continue.
Any parameters provided as part of the `input` submission will be available in the environment for the rest of the `stage`.

##### Configuration options [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#configuration-options)

message

Required.
This will be presented to the user when they go to submit the `input`.

id

An optional identifier for this `input`.
The default value is based on the `stage` name.

ok

Optional text for the "ok" button on the `input` form.

submitter

An optional comma-separated list of users or external group names who are allowed to submit this `input`.
Defaults to allowing any user.

submitterParameter

An optional name of an environment variable to set with the `submitter` name, if present.

parameters

An optional list of parameters to prompt the submitter to provide.
Refer to [parameters](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#parameters) for more information.

Example 14. Input Step, Declarative Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            input {
                message "Should we continue?"
                ok "Yes, we should."

#### when [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#when)

The `when` directive allows the Pipeline to determine whether the stage should be executed depending on the given condition.
The `when` directive must contain at least one condition.
If the `when` directive contains more than one condition, all the child conditions must return true for the stage to execute.
This is the same as if the child conditions were nested in an `allOf` condition (refer to the [examples](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#when-example) below).
If an `anyOf` condition is used, note that the condition skips remaining tests as soon as the first "true" condition is found.

More complex conditional structures can be built using the nesting conditions: `not`, `allOf`, or `anyOf`.
Nesting conditions may be nested to any arbitrary depth.

| Required | No |
| Parameters | _None_ |
| Allowed | Inside a `stage` directive |

##### Built-in Conditions [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#built-in-conditions)

branch

Execute the stage when the branch being built matches the branch pattern (ANT style path glob) given, for example: `when { branch 'master' }`. Note that this only works on a multibranch Pipeline.

The optional parameter `comparator` may be added after an attribute to specify how any patterns are evaluated for a match:

- `EQUALS` for a simple string comparison

- `GLOB` (the default) for an ANT style path glob (same as for example `changeset`)

- `REGEXP` for regular expression matching


For example: `when { branch pattern: "release-\\d+", comparator: "REGEXP"}`

buildingTag

Execute the stage when the build is building a tag.
For example: `when { buildingTag() }`

changelog

Execute the stage if the build’s SCM changelog contains a given regular expression pattern, for example: `when { changelog '.*^\\[DEPENDENCY\\] .+$' }`.

changeset

Execute the stage if the build’s SCM changeset contains one or more files matching the given pattern.
Example: `when { changeset "**/*.js" }`

The optional parameter `comparator` may be added after an attribute to specify how any patterns are evaluated for a match:

- `EQUALS` for a simple string comparison

- `GLOB` (the default) for an ANT style path glob case insensitive (this can be turned off with the `caseSensitive` parameter).

- `REGEXP` for regular expression matching


For example: `when { changeset pattern: ".TEST\\.java", comparator: "REGEXP" }` **or `when { changeset pattern: "`** `*/*TEST.java", caseSensitive: true }`

changeRequest

Executes the stage if the current build is for a "change request" (a.k.a. Pull Request on GitHub and Bitbucket, Merge Request on GitLab, Change in Gerrit, etc.).
When no parameters are passed the stage runs on every change request, for example: `when { changeRequest() }`.

By adding a filter attribute with parameter to the change request, the stage can be made to run only on matching change requests.
Possible attributes are `id`, `target`, `branch`, `fork`, `url`, `title`, `author`, `authorDisplayName`, and `authorEmail`.
Each of these corresponds to a `CHANGE_*` environment variable, for example: `when { changeRequest target: 'master' }`.

The optional parameter `comparator` may be added after an attribute to specify how any patterns are evaluated for a match:

- `EQUALS` for a simple string comparison (the default)

- `GLOB` for an ANT style path glob (same as for example `changeset`)

- `REGEXP` for regular expression matching


Example: `when { changeRequest authorEmail: "[\\w_-.]+@example.com", comparator: 'REGEXP' }`

environment

Execute the stage when the specified environment variable is set to the given value, for example: `when { environment name: 'DEPLOY_TO', value: 'production' }`.

equals

Execute the stage when the expected value is equal to the actual value, for example: `when { equals expected: 2, actual: currentBuild.number }`.

expression

Execute the stage when the specified Groovy expression evaluates to true, for example: `when { expression { return params.DEBUG_BUILD } }`.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | When returning strings from your expressions they must be converted to booleans or return `null` to evaluate to false. Simply returning "0" or "false" will still evaluate to "true". |

tag

Execute the stage if the `TAG_NAME` variable matches the given pattern.
For example: `when { tag "release-*" }`
If an empty pattern is provided the stage will execute if the `TAG_NAME` variable exists (same as `buildingTag()`).

The optional parameter `comparator` may be added after an attribute to specify how any patterns are evaluated for a match:

- `EQUALS` for a simple string comparison,

- `GLOB` (the default) for an ANT style path glob (same as for example `changeset`), or

- `REGEXP` for regular expression matching.


For example: `when { tag pattern: "release-\\d+", comparator: "REGEXP"}`

not

Execute the stage when the nested condition is false.
Must contain one condition.
For example: `when { not { branch 'master' } }`

allOf

Execute the stage when all of the nested conditions are true.
Must contain at least one condition.
For example: `when { allOf { branch 'master'; environment name: 'DEPLOY_TO', value: 'production' } }`

anyOf

Execute the stage when at least one of the nested conditions is true.
Must contain at least one condition.
For example: `when { anyOf { branch 'master'; branch 'staging' } }`

triggeredBy

Execute the stage when the current build has been triggered by the param given.
For example:

- `when { triggeredBy 'SCMTrigger' }`

- `when { triggeredBy 'TimerTrigger' }`

- `when { triggeredBy 'BuildUpstreamCause' }`

- `when { triggeredBy  cause: "UserIdCause", detail: "vlinde" }`


##### Evaluating `when` before entering `agent` in a `stage` [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#evaluating-when-before-entering-agent-in-a-stage)

By default, the `when` condition for a `stage` will be evaluated after entering the `agent` for that `stage`, if one is defined.
However, this can be changed by specifying the `beforeAgent` option within the `when` block.
If `beforeAgent` is set to `true`, the `when` condition will be evaluated first, and the `agent` will only be entered if the `when` condition evaluates to true.

##### Evaluating `when` before the `input` directive [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#evaluating-when-before-the-input-directive)

By default, the when condition for a stage will not be evaluated before the input, if one is defined.
However, this can be changed by specifying the `beforeInput` option within the when block.
If `beforeInput` is set to true, the when condition will be evaluated first, and the input will only be entered if the when condition evaluates to true.

`beforeInput true` takes precedence over `beforeAgent true`.

##### Evaluating `when` before the `options` directive [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#evaluating-when-before-the-options-directive)

By default, the `when` condition for a `stage` will be evaluated after entering the `options` for that `stage`, if any are defined.
However, this can be changed by specifying the `beforeOptions` option within the `when` block.
If `beforeOptions` is set to `true`, the `when` condition will be evaluated first, and the `options` will only be entered if the `when` condition evaluates to true.

`beforeOptions true` takes precedence over `beforeInput true` and `beforeAgent true`.

    stages {
        stage('Example Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Example Deploy') {
            when {
                branch 'production'
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying'

### Sequential Stages [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#sequential-stages)

Stages in Declarative Pipeline may have a `stages` section containing a list of nested stages to be run in sequential order.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | A stage must have one and only one of `steps`, `stages`, `parallel`, or `matrix`.<br>It is not possible to nest a `parallel` or `matrix` block within a `stage` directive if that `stage` directive is nested within a `parallel` or `matrix` block itself.<br>However, a `stage` directive within a `parallel` or `matrix` block can use all other functionality of a `stage`, including `agent`, `tools`, `when`, etc. |

    stages {
        stage('Non-Sequential Stage') {
            agent {

            }
            environment {
                FOR_SEQUENTIAL = "some-value"
            }
            stages {

### Parallel [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#parallel)

Stages in Declarative Pipeline may have a `parallel` section containing a list of nested stages to be run in parallel.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | A stage must have one and only one of `steps`, `stages`, `parallel`, or `matrix`.<br>It is not possible to nest a `parallel` or `matrix` block within a `stage` directive if that `stage` directive is nested within a `parallel` or `matrix` block itself.<br>However, a `stage` directive within a `parallel` or `matrix` block can use all other functionality of a `stage`, including `agent`, `tools`, `when`, etc. |

In addition, you can force your `parallel` stages to all be aborted when any one of them fails, by adding `failFast true` to the `stage` containing the `parallel`.
Another option for adding `failfast` is adding an option to the pipeline definition: `parallelsAlwaysFailFast()`.

Example 25. Parallel Stages, Declarative Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Non-Parallel Stage') {
            steps {
                echo 'This stage will be executed first.'
            }
        }
        stage('Parallel Stage') {
            when {
                branch 'master'

            failFast true
            parallel {
                stage('Branch A') {
                    agent {
                        label "for-branch-a"

                    steps {
                        echo "On Branch A"

### Matrix [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#declarative-matrix)

Stages in Declarative Pipeline may have a `matrix` section defining a multi-dimensional matrix of name-value combinations to be run in parallel.
We’ll refer these combinations as "cells" in a matrix.
Each cell in a matrix can include one or more stages to be run sequentially using the configuration for that cell.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | A stage must have one and only one of `steps`, `stages`, `parallel`, or `matrix`.<br>It is not possible to nest a `parallel` or `matrix` block within a `stage` directive if that `stage` directive is nested within a `parallel` or `matrix` block itself.<br>However, a `stage` directive within a `parallel` or `matrix` block can use all other functionality of a `stage`, including `agent`, `tools`, `when`, etc. |

In addition, you can force your `matrix` cells to all be aborted when any one of them fails, by adding `failFast true` to the `stage` containing the `matrix`.
Another option for adding `failfast` is adding an option to the pipeline definition: `parallelsAlwaysFailFast()`.

The `matrix` section must include an `axes` section and a `stages` section.
The `axes` section defines the values for each `axis` in the matrix.
The `stages` section defines a list of `stage` s to run sequentially in each cell.
A `matrix` may have an `excludes` section to remove invalid cells from the matrix.
Many of the directives available on `stage`, including `agent`, `tools`, `when`, etc., can also be added to `matrix` to control the behavior of each cell.

#### axes [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#matrix-axes)

The `axes` section specifies one or more `axis` directives.
Each `axis` consists of a `name` and a list of `values`.
All the values from each axis are combined with the others to produce the cells.

Example 27. One-axis with 3 cells

```
matrix {
    axes {
        axis {
            name 'PLATFORM'
            values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows'
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

Example 28. Two-axis with 12 cells (three by four)

```
matrix {
    axes {
        axis {
            name 'PLATFORM'
            values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows'
        }
        axis {
            name 'BROWSER'
            values 'chrome', 'edge', 'firefox', 'safari'
        }
    }
    // ...
}

#### stages [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#matrix-stages)

The `stages` section specifies one or more `stage` s to be executed sequentially in each cell.
This section is identical to any other [`stages` section](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#sequential-stages).

Example 30. One-axis with 3 cells, each cell runs three stages - "build", "test", and "deploy"

```
matrix {
    axes {
        axis {
            name 'PLATFORM'
            values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            // ...
        }
        stage('test') {
            // ...
        }
        stage('deploy') {
            // ...
        }
    }
}

#### excludes (optional) [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#matrix-excludes)

The optional `excludes` section lets authors specify one or more `exclude` filter expressions that select cells to be excluded from the expanded set of matrix cells (aka, sparsening).
Filters are constructed using a basic directive structure of one or more of exclude `axis` directives each with a `name` and `values` list.

The `axis` directives inside an `exclude` generate a set of combinations (similar to generating the matrix cells).
The matrix cells that match all the values from an `exclude` combination are removed from the matrix.
If more than one `exclude` directive is supplied, each is evaluated separately to remove cells.

When dealing with a long list of values to exclude, exclude `axis` directives can use `notValues` instead of `values`.
These will exclude cells that **do not** match one of the values passed to `notValues`.

Example 32. Three-axis matrix with 24 cells, exclude '32-bit, mac' (4 cells excluded)

```
matrix {
    axes {
        axis {
            name 'PLATFORM'
            values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows'
        }
        axis {
            name 'BROWSER'
            values 'chrome', 'edge', 'firefox', 'safari'
        }
        axis {
            name 'ARCHITECTURE'
            values '32-bit', '64-bit'
        }
    }
    excludes {
        exclude {
            axis {
                name 'PLATFORM'
                values 'mac'
            }
            axis {
                name 'ARCHITECTURE'
                values '32-bit'
            }
        }
    }
    // ...
}
```

Exclude the `linux, safari` combination and exclude any platform that is **not** `windows` with the `edge` browser.

#### Matrix cell-level directives (optional) [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#matrix-cell-directives)

Matrix lets users efficiently configure the overall environment for each cell, by adding stage-level directives under `matrix` itself.
These directives behave the same as they would on a stage but they can also accept values provided by the matrix for each cell.

The `axis` and `exclude` directives define the static set of cells that make up the matrix.
That set of combinations is generated before the start of the pipeline run.
The "per-cell" directives, on the other hand, are evaluated at runtime.

These directives include:

- [agent](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#agent)

- [environment](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#environment)

- [input](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#input)

- [options](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#options)

- [post](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post)

- [tools](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#tools)

- [when](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#when)

### Steps [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#declarative-steps)

Declarative Pipelines may use all the available steps documented in the [Pipeline Steps reference](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps), which contains a comprehensive list of steps, with the addition of the steps listed below which are **only supported** in Declarative Pipeline.

#### script [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#script)

The `script` step takes a block of [Scripted Pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#scripted-pipeline) and executes that in the Declarative Pipeline.
For most use-cases, the `script` step should be unnecessary in Declarative Pipelines, but it can provide a useful "escape hatch".
`script` blocks of non-trivial size and/or complexity should be moved into [Shared Libraries](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) instead.

Example 35. Script Block in Declarative Pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'

                script {
                    def browsers = ['chrome', 'firefox']
                    for (int i = 0; i < browsers.size(); ++i) {
                        echo "Testing the ${browsers[i]} browser"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Scripted Pipeline [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#scripted-pipeline)

Scripted Pipeline, like [Declarative Pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline), is built on top of the underlying Pipeline sub-system.
Unlike Declarative, Scripted Pipeline is effectively a general-purpose DSL \[ [1](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")\] built with [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html).
Most functionality provided by the Groovy language is made available to users of Scripted Pipeline, which means it can be a very expressive and flexible tool with which one can author continuous delivery pipelines.

### Flow Control [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#flow-control)

Scripted Pipeline is serially executed from the top of a `Jenkinsfile` downwards, like most traditional scripts in Groovy or other languages.
Providing flow control, therefore, rests on Groovy expressions, such as the `if/else` conditionals, for example:

Example 36. Conditional Statement `if`, Scripted Pipeline

```
node {
    stage('Example') {
        if (env.BRANCH_NAME == 'master') {
            echo 'I only execute on the master branch'
        } else {
            echo 'I execute elsewhere'
        }
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

Another way Scripted Pipeline flow control can be managed is with Groovy’s exception handling support.
When [Steps](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#scripted-steps) fail for whatever reason they throw an exception.
Handling behaviors on-error must make use of the `try/catch/finally` blocks in Groovy, for example:

Example 37. Try-Catch Block, Scripted Pipeline

```
node {
    stage('Example') {
        try {
            sh 'exit 1'
        }
        catch (exc) {
            echo 'Something failed, I should sound the klaxons!'
            throw
        }
    }
}
```

### Steps [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#scripted-steps)

As discussed at the [start of this chapter](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/), the most fundamental part of a Pipeline is the "step".
Fundamentally, steps tell Jenkins _what_ to do and serve as the basic building block for both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline syntax.

Scripted Pipeline does **not** introduce any steps which are specific to its syntax; [Pipeline Steps reference](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps) contains a comprehensive list of steps provided by Pipeline and plugins.

### Differences from plain Groovy [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/\#differences-from-plain-groovy)

In order to provide _durability_, which means that running Pipelines can survive a restart of the Jenkins [controller](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/#controller), Scripted Pipeline must serialize data back to the controller.
Due to this design requirement, some Groovy idioms such as `collection.each { item → /* perform operation */ }` are not fully supported.
Refer to [JENKINS-27421](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-27421) and [JENKINS-26481](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-26481) for more information.

This video shares some differences between Scripted and Declarative Pipeline syntax.

When Jenkins Pipeline was first created, Groovy was selected as the foundation.
Jenkins has long shipped with an embedded Groovy engine to provide advanced scripting capabilities for admins and users alike.
Additionally, the implementors of Jenkins Pipeline found Groovy to be a solid foundation upon which to build what is now referred to as the "Scripted Pipeline" DSL. \[ [1](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")\].

As it is a fully-featured programming environment, Scripted Pipeline offers a tremendous amount of flexibility and extensibility to Jenkins users.
The Groovy learning-curve isn’t typically desirable for all members of a given team, so Declarative Pipeline was created to offer a simpler and more opinionated syntax for authoring Jenkins Pipeline.

Both are fundamentally the same Pipeline sub-system underneath.
They are both durable implementations of "Pipeline as code".
They are both able to use steps built into Pipeline or provided by plugins.
Both are able to utilize [Shared Libraries](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/)

Where they differ however is in syntax and flexibility.
Declarative limits what is available to the user with a more strict and pre-defined structure, making it an ideal choice for simpler continuous delivery pipelines.
Scripted provides very few limits, insofar that the only limits on structure and syntax tend to be defined by Groovy itself, rather than any Pipeline-specific systems, making it an ideal choice for power-users and those with more complex
requirements.
As the name implies, Declarative Pipeline encourages a declarative programming model.
\[ [2](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#_footnotedef_2 "View footnote.")\]
Whereas Scripted Pipelines follow a more imperative programming model.

This section builds on the information covered in [Getting started with Pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started) and introduces more useful steps, common patterns, and demonstrates some non-trivial `Jenkinsfile` examples.

Creating a `Jenkinsfile`, which is checked into source control \[ [1](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")\], provides a number of immediate benefits:

- Code review/iteration on the Pipeline

- Audit trail for the Pipeline

- Single source of truth \[ [2](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#_footnotedef_2 "View footnote.")\] for the Pipeline, which can be viewed and edited by multiple members of the project.


Pipeline supports [two syntaxes](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax), Declarative (introduced in Pipeline 2.5) and Scripted Pipeline.
Both of which support building continuous delivery pipelines.
Both may be used to define a Pipeline in either the web UI or with a `Jenkinsfile`, though it’s generally considered a best practice to create a `Jenkinsfile` and check the file into the source control repository.

## Creating a Jenkinsfile [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#creating-a-jenkinsfile)

As discussed in the [Defining a Pipeline in SCM](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm), a `Jenkinsfile` is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into source control.
Consider the following Pipeline which implements a basic three-stage continuous delivery pipeline.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying....'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

    }
    stage('Test') {

    }
}
```

Not all Pipelines will have these same three stages, but it is a good starting point to define them for most projects.
The sections below will demonstrate the creation and execution of a simple Pipeline in a test installation of Jenkins.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | It is assumed that there is already a source control repository set up for the project and a Pipeline has been defined in Jenkins following [these instructions](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm). |

Using a text editor, ideally one which supports [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) syntax highlighting, create a new `Jenkinsfile` in the root directory of the project.

The Declarative Pipeline example above contains the minimum necessary structure to implement a continuous delivery pipeline.
The [agent directive](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#agent), which is required, instructs Jenkins to allocate an executor and workspace for the Pipeline.
Without an `agent` directive, not only is the Declarative Pipeline not valid, it would not be capable of doing any work!
By default the `agent` directive ensures that the source repository is checked out and made available for steps in the subsequent stages.

The [stages directive](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stages) and [steps directives](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps) are also required for a valid Declarative Pipeline as they instruct Jenkins what to execute and in which stage it should be executed.

For more advanced usage with Scripted Pipeline, the example above `node` is a crucial first step as it allocates an executor and workspace for the Pipeline.
In essence, without `node`, a Pipeline cannot do any work! From within `node`, the first order of business will be to checkout the source code for this project.
Since the `Jenkinsfile` is being pulled directly from source control, Pipeline provides a quick and easy way to access the right revision of the source code.

Jenkinsfile (Scripted Pipeline)

```groovy
node {
    checkout scm (1)
    /* .. snip .. */
}
```

groovyCopied!

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | The `checkout` step will checkout code from source control; `scm` is a special variable which instructs the `checkout` step to clone the specific revision which triggered this Pipeline run. |

### Build [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#build)

For many projects the beginning of "work" in the Pipeline would be the "build" stage.
Typically this stage of the Pipeline will be where source code is assembled, compiled, or packaged.
The `Jenkinsfile` is **not** a replacement for an existing build tool such as GNU/Make, Maven, Gradle, or others, but rather can be viewed as a glue layer to bind the multiple phases of a project’s development lifecycle (build, test, deploy) together.

Jenkins has a number of plugins for invoking practically any build tool in general use, but this example will simply invoke `make` from a shell step ( `sh`).
The `sh` step assumes the system is Unix/Linux-based, for Windows-based systems the `bat` could be used instead.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make' (1)
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', fingerprint: true (2)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

    }
}
```

| --- | --- |
| **1** | The `sh` step invokes the `make` command and will only continue if a zero exit code is returned by the command.<br>Any non-zero exit code will fail the Pipeline. |
| **2** | `archiveArtifacts` captures the files built matching the include pattern ( `**/target/*.jar`) and saves them to the Jenkins controller for later retrieval. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | Archiving artifacts is not a substitute for using external artifact repositories such as Artifactory or Nexus and should be considered only for basic reporting and file archival. |

### Test [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#test)

Running automated tests is a crucial component of any successful continuous delivery process.
As such, Jenkins has a number of test recording, reporting, and visualization facilities provided by a [number of plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/?labels=report).
At a fundamental level, when there are test failures, it is useful to have Jenkins record the failures for reporting and visualization in the web UI.
The example below uses the `junit` step, provided by the [JUnit plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit).

In the example below, if tests fail, the Pipeline is marked "unstable", as denoted by a yellow ball in the web UI.
Based on the recorded test reports, Jenkins can also provide historical trend analysis and visualization.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                /* `make check` returns non-zero on test failures,
                * using `true` to allow the Pipeline to continue nonetheless
                */
                sh 'make check || true' (1)
                junit '**/target/*.xml' (2)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

        sh 'make check || true' (1)

| **1** | Using an inline shell conditional ( `sh 'make check || true'`) ensures that the `sh` step always sees a zero exit code, giving the `junit` step the opportunity to capture and process the test reports.<br>Alternative approaches to this are covered in more detail in the [Handling failure](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#handling-failure) section below. |
| **2** | `junit` captures and associates the JUnit XML files matching the inclusion pattern ( `**/target/*.xml`). |

### Deploy [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#deploy)

Deployment can imply a variety of steps, depending on the project or organization requirements, and may be anything from publishing built artifacts to an Artifactory server, to pushing code to a production system.

At this stage of the example Pipeline, both the "Build" and "Test" stages have successfully executed.
In essence, the "Deploy" stage will only execute assuming previous stages completed successfully, otherwise the Pipeline would have exited early.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            when {
              expression {
                currentBuild.result == null || currentBuild.result == 'SUCCESS' (1)
              }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'make publish'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

        }
    }

| **1** | Accessing the `currentBuild.result` variable allows the Pipeline to determine if there were any test failures.<br>In which case, the value would be `UNSTABLE`. |

Assuming everything has executed successfully in the example Jenkins Pipeline, each successful Pipeline run will have associated build artifacts archived, test results reported upon and the full console output all in Jenkins.

A Scripted Pipeline can include conditional tests (shown above), loops, try/catch/finally blocks, and even functions.
The next section will cover this advanced Scripted Pipeline syntax in more detail.

## Working with your Jenkinsfile [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#working-with-your-jenkinsfile)

The following sections provide details about handling:

- specific Pipeline syntax in your `Jenkinsfile` and

- features and functionality of Pipeline syntax which are essential in building your application or Pipeline project.


### Using environment variables [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#using-environment-variables)

Jenkins Pipeline exposes environment variables via the global variable `env`, which is available from anywhere within a `Jenkinsfile`.
The full list of environment variables accessible from within Jenkins Pipeline is documented at ${YOUR\_JENKINS\_URL}/pipeline-syntax/globals#env and includes:

BUILD\_ID

The current build ID, identical to BUILD\_NUMBER for builds created in Jenkins versions 1.597+.

BUILD\_NUMBER

The current build number, such as "153".

BUILD\_TAG

String of jenkins-${JOB\_NAME}-${BUILD\_NUMBER}. Convenient to put into a resource file, a jar file, etc for easier identification.

BUILD\_URL

The URL where the results of this build can be found (for example, http://buildserver/jenkins/job/MyJobName/17/).

EXECUTOR\_NUMBER

The unique number that identifies the current executor (among executors of the same machine) performing this build. This is the number you see in the "build executor status", except that the number starts from 0, not 1.

JAVA\_HOME

If your job is configured to use a specific JDK, this variable is set to the JAVA\_HOME of the specified JDK. When this variable is set, PATH is also updated to include the bin subdirectory of JAVA\_HOME.

JENKINS\_URL

Full URL of Jenkins, such as https://example.com:port/jenkins/ (NOTE: only available if Jenkins URL set in "System Configuration").

JOB\_NAME

Name of the project of this build, such as "foo" or "foo/bar".

NODE\_NAME

The name of the node the current build is running on. Set to 'master' for the Jenkins controller.

WORKSPACE

The absolute path of the workspace.

Referencing or using these environment variables can be accomplished like accessing any key in a Groovy [Map](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_maps), for example:

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo "Running ${env.BUILD_ID} on ${env.JENKINS_URL}"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Setting environment variables [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#setting-environment-variables)

Setting an environment variable within a Jenkins Pipeline is accomplished differently depending on whether Declarative or Scripted Pipeline is used.

Declarative Pipeline supports an [environment](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#environment) directive, whereas users of Scripted Pipeline must use the `withEnv` step.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment { (1)
        CC = 'clang'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            environment { (2)
                DEBUG_FLAGS = '-g'
            }
            steps {
                sh 'printenv'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

node {

    withEnv(["PATH+MAVEN=${tool 'M3'}/bin"]) {
        sh 'mvn -B verify'
    }
}
```

| **1** | An `environment` directive used in the top-level `pipeline` block will apply to all steps within the Pipeline. |
| **2** | An `environment` directive defined within a `stage` will only apply the given environment variables to steps within the `stage`. |

#### Setting environment variables dynamically [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#setting-environment-variables-dynamically)

Environment variables can be set at run time and can be used by shell scripts ( `sh`), Windows batch scripts ( `bat`) and PowerShell scripts ( `powershell`).
Each script can either `returnStatus` or `returnStdout`.
[More information on scripts](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step).

Below is an example in a declarative pipeline using `sh` (shell) with both `returnStatus` and `returnStdout`.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any (1)
    environment {
        // Using returnStdout
        CC = """${sh(
                returnStdout: true,
                script: 'echo "clang"'
            )}""" (2)
        // Using returnStatus
        EXIT_STATUS = """${sh(
                returnStatus: true,
                script: 'exit 1'
            )}"""
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            environment {
                DEBUG_FLAGS = '-g'
            }
            steps {
                sh 'printenv'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| **1** | An `agent` must be set at the top level of the pipeline.<br>This will fail if agent is set as `agent none`. |
| **2** | When using `returnStdout` a trailing whitespace will be appended to the returned string.<br>Use `.trim()` to remove this. |

#### For secret text, usernames and passwords, and secret files [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#for-secret-text-usernames-and-passwords-and-secret-files)

Jenkins' declarative Pipeline syntax has the `credentials()` helper method (used within the [`environment`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#environment) directive) which supports [secret text](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#secret-text), [username and password](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#usernames-and-passwords), as well as [secret file](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#secret-files) credentials.
If you want to handle other types of credentials, refer to the [For other credential types](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#for-other-credential-types) section.

##### Secret text [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#secret-text)

The following Pipeline code shows an example of how to create a Pipeline using environment variables for secret text credentials.

In this example, two secret text credentials are assigned to separate environment variables to access Amazon Web Services (AWS).
These credentials would have been configured in Jenkins with their respective credential IDs `jenkins-aws-secret-key-id` and `jenkins-aws-secret-access-key`.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        // Define agent details here
    }
    environment {
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     = credentials('jenkins-aws-secret-key-id')
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = credentials('jenkins-aws-secret-access-key')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example stage 1') {
            steps {
                // (1)
            }
        }
        stage('Example stage 2') {
            steps {
                // (2)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

| **1** | You can reference the two credential environment variables (defined in this Pipeline’s [`environment`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#environment) directive), within this stage’s steps using the syntax `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.<br>For example, here you can authenticate to AWS using the secret text credentials assigned to these credential variables.<br>To maintain the security and anonymity of these credentials, if the job displays the value of these credential variables from within the Pipeline (such as `echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), Jenkins only returns the value “\*\*\*\*” to reduce the risk of secret information being disclosed to the console output and any logs.<br>Any sensitive information in credential IDs themselves (such as usernames) are also returned as “\*\*\*\*” in the Pipeline run’s output.<br>This only reduces the risk of **accidental exposure**.<br>It does not prevent a malicious user from capturing the credential value by other means.<br>A Pipeline that uses credentials can also disclose those credentials.<br>Don’t allow untrusted Pipeline jobs to use trusted credentials. |
| **2** | In this Pipeline example, the credentials assigned to the two `AWS_…​` environment variables are scoped globally for the entire Pipeline, so these credential variables could also be used in this stage’s steps.<br>If, however, the `environment` directive in this Pipeline were moved to a specific stage (as is the case in the [Usernames and passwords](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#usernames-and-passwords) Pipeline example below), then these `AWS_…​` environment variables would only be scoped to the steps in that stage. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | Storing static AWS keys in Jenkins credentials is not very secure.<br>If you can run Jenkins itself in AWS (at least the agent), it is preferable to use IAM roles for a [computer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html) or [EKS service account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).<br>It is also possible to use [web identity federation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/oidc-provider-plugin#accessing-aws). |

##### Usernames and passwords [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#usernames-and-passwords)

The following Pipeline code snippets show an example of how to create a Pipeline using environment variables for username and password credentials.

In this example, username and password credentials are assigned to environment variables to access a Bitbucket repository in a common account or team for your organization; these credentials would have been configured in Jenkins with the credential ID `jenkins-bitbucket-common-creds`.

When setting the credential environment variable in the [`environment`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#environment) directive:

```
environment {
    BITBUCKET_COMMON_CREDS = credentials('jenkins-bitbucket-common-creds')
}
```

groovyCopied!

this actually sets the following three environment variables:

- `BITBUCKET_COMMON_CREDS` \- contains a username and a password separated by a colon in the format `username:password`.

- `BITBUCKET_COMMON_CREDS_USR` \- an additional variable containing the username component only.

- `BITBUCKET_COMMON_CREDS_PSW` \- an additional variable containing the password component only.


|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | By convention, variable names for environment variables are typically specified in capital case, with individual words separated by underscores<br>You can, however, specify any legitimate variable name using lower case characters.<br>Bear in mind that the additional environment variables created by the `credentials()` method (above) will always be appended with `_USR` and `_PSW` (i.e. in the format of an underscore followed by three capital letters). |

The following code snippet shows the example Pipeline in its entirety:

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        // Define agent details here
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example stage 1') {
            environment {

##### Secret files [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#secret-files)

A secret file is a credential which is stored in a file and uploaded to Jenkins.
Secret files are used for credentials that are:

- too unwieldy to enter directly into Jenkins, and/or

- in binary format, such as a GPG file.


In this example, we use a Kubernetes config file that has been configured as a secret file credential named `my-kubeconfig`.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        // Define agent details here
    }
    environment {
        // The MY_KUBECONFIG environment variable will be assigned the value of a temporary file.
        // For example:
        //   /home/user/.jenkins/workspace/cred_test@tmp/secretFiles/546a5cf3-9b56-4165-a0fd-19e2afe6b31f/kubeconfig.txt
        MY_KUBECONFIG = credentials('my-kubeconfig')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example stage 1') {
            steps {
                sh("kubectl --kubeconfig $MY_KUBECONFIG get pods")
            }
        }
    }
}

#### For other credential types [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#for-other-credential-types)

If you need to set credentials in a Pipeline for anything other than secret text, usernames and passwords, or [secret files](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#for-secret-text-usernames-and-passwords-and-secret-files) like SSH keys or certificates, use Jenkins' **Snippet Generator** feature, which you can access through Jenkins' classic UI.

To access the **Snippet Generator** for your Pipeline project/item:

1. From the Jenkins Dashboard, select the name of your Pipeline project/item.

2. In the left navigation pane, select **Pipeline Syntax** and ensure that the **Snippet Generator** option is available at the top of the navigation pane.

3. From the **Sample Step** field, choose **withCredentials: Bind credentials to variables**.

4. Under **Bindings**, click **Add** and choose from the dropdown:



- **SSH User Private Key** \- to handle [SSH public/private key pair credentials](http://www.snailbook.com/protocols.html), from which you can specify:



- **Key File Variable** \- the name of the environment variable that will be bound to these credentials.
Jenkins actually assigns this temporary variable to the secure location of the private key file required in the SSH public/private key pair authentication process.

- **Passphrase Variable** ( _Optional_ ) \- the name of the environment variable that will be bound to the [passphrase](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4251#section-9.4.4) associated with the SSH public/private key pair.

- **Username Variable** ( _Optional_ ) \- the name of the environment variable that will be bound to username associated with the SSH public/private key pair.

- **Credentials** \- choose the SSH public/private key credentials stored in Jenkins.
The value of this field is the credential ID, which Jenkins writes out to the generated snippet.


- **Certificate** \- to handle [PKCS#12 certificates](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7292), from which you can specify:



- **Keystore Variable** \- the name of the environment variable that will be bound to these credentials.
Jenkins actually assigns this temporary variable to the secure location of the certificate’s keystore required in the certificate authentication process.

- **Password Variable** ( _Optional_ ) \- the name of the environment variable that will be bound to the password associated with the certificate.

- **Alias Variable** ( _Optional_ ) \- the name of the environment variable that will be bound to the unique alias associated with the certificate.

- **Credentials** \- choose the certificate credentials stored in Jenkins.
The value of this field is the credential ID, which Jenkins writes out to the generated snippet.


- **Docker client certificate** \- to handle Docker Host Certificate Authentication.


5. Click **Generate Pipeline Script** and Jenkins generates a `withCredentials(…​) { …​ }` Pipeline step snippet for the credentials you specified, which you can then copy and paste into your Declarative or Scripted Pipeline code.

**Notes:**



- The **Credentials** fields (above) show the names of credentials configured in Jenkins.
However, these values are converted to credential IDs after clicking **Generate Pipeline Script**.

- To combine more than one credential in a single `withCredentials(…​) { …​ }` Pipeline step, see [Combining credentials in one step](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#combining-credentials-in-one-step) (below) for details.


**SSH User Private Key example**

```
withCredentials(bindings: [sshUserPrivateKey(credentialsId: 'jenkins-ssh-key-for-abc', \\
                                             keyFileVariable: 'SSH_KEY_FOR_ABC', \\
                                             passphraseVariable: '', \\
                                             usernameVariable: '')]) {
  // some block
}
```

groovyCopied!

The optional `passphraseVariable` and `usernameVariable` definitions can be deleted in your final Pipeline code.

**Certificate example**

```
withCredentials(bindings: [certificate(aliasVariable: '', \\
                                       credentialsId: 'jenkins-certificate-for-xyz', \\
                                       keystoreVariable: 'CERTIFICATE_FOR_XYZ', \\
                                       passwordVariable: 'XYZ-CERTIFICATE-PASSWORD')]) {
  // some block
}
```

The optional `aliasVariable` and `passwordVariable` variable definitions can be deleted in your final Pipeline code.

The following code snippet shows an example Pipeline in its entirety, which implements the **SSH User Private Key** and **Certificate** snippets above:

        stage('Example stage 2') {
            steps {
                // (3)
            }
        }
    }

### String interpolation [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#string-interpolation)

Jenkins Pipeline uses rules identical to [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) for string interpolation.
Groovy’s String interpolation support can be confusing to many newcomers to the language.
While Groovy supports declaring a string with either single quotes, or double quotes, for example:

```
def singlyQuoted = 'Hello'
def doublyQuoted = "World"
```

groovyCopied!

Only the latter string will support the dollar-sign ( `$`) based string
interpolation, for example:

```
def username = 'Jenkins'
echo 'Hello Mr. ${username}'
echo "I said, Hello Mr. ${username}"
```

groovyCopied!

Would result in:

```
Hello Mr. ${username}
I said, Hello Mr. Jenkins
```

Understanding how to use string interpolation is vital for using some of
Pipeline’s more advanced features.

#### Interpolation of sensitive environment variables [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#interpolation-of-sensitive-environment-variables)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | Groovy string interpolation should **never** be used with credentials. |

Groovy string interpolation can leak sensitive environment variables (i.e. credentials, see: [Handling credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#handling-credentials)).
This is because the sensitive environment variable will be interpolated during Groovy evaluation, and the environment variable’s value could be made available earlier than intended, resulting in sensitive data leaking in various contexts.

For example, consider a sensitive environment variable passed to the `sh` step.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        EXAMPLE_CREDS = credentials('example-credentials-id')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                /* WRONG! */
                sh("curl -u ${EXAMPLE_CREDS_USR}:${EXAMPLE_CREDS_PSW} https://example.com/")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

Should Groovy perform the interpolation, the sensitive value will be injected directly into the arguments of the `sh` step, which among other issues, means that the literal value will be visible as an argument to the `sh` process on the agent in OS process listings.
Using single-quotes instead of double-quotes when referencing these sensitive environment variables prevents this type of leaking.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        EXAMPLE_CREDS = credentials('example-credentials-id')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                /* CORRECT */
                sh('curl -u $EXAMPLE_CREDS_USR:$EXAMPLE_CREDS_PSW https://example.com/')
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Injection via interpolation [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#injection-via-interpolation)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | Groovy string interpolation can inject rogue commands into command interpreters via special characters. |

Another note of caution.
Using Groovy string interpolation for user-controlled variables with steps that pass their arguments to command interpreters such as the `sh`, `bat`, `powershell`, or `pwsh` steps can result in problems analogous to SQL injection.
This occurs when a user-controlled variable (generally an environment variable, usually a parameter passed to the build) that contains special characters (e.g. `/ \ $ & % ^ > < | ;`) is passed to the `sh`, `bat`, `powershell`, or `pwsh` steps using Groovy interpolation.
For a simple example:

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  parameters {
    string(name: 'STATEMENT', defaultValue: 'hello; ls /', description: 'What should I say?')
  }
  stages {
    stage('Example') {
      steps {
        /* WRONG! */
        sh("echo ${STATEMENT}")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

groovyCopied!

In this example, the argument to the `sh` step is evaluated by Groovy, and `STATEMENT` is interpolated directly into the argument as if `sh('echo hello; ls /')` has been written in the Pipeline.
When this is processed on the agent, rather than echoing the value `hello; ls /`, it will echo `hello` then proceed to list the entire root directory of the agent.
Any user able to control a variable interpolated by such a step would be able to make the `sh` step run arbitrary code on the agent.
To avoid this problem, make sure arguments to steps such as `sh` or `bat` that reference parameters or other user-controlled environment variables use single quotes to avoid Groovy interpolation.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  parameters {
    string(name: 'STATEMENT', defaultValue: 'hello; ls /', description: 'What should I say?')
  }
  stages {
    stage('Example') {
      steps {
        /* CORRECT */
        sh('echo ${STATEMENT}')
      }
    }
  }
}
```

groovyCopied!

Credential mangling is another issue that can occur when credentials that contain special characters are passed to a step using Groovy interpolation.
When the credential value is mangled, it is no longer valid and will no longer be masked in the console log.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
    EXAMPLE_KEY = credentials('example-credentials-id') // Secret value is 'sec%ret'
  }
  stages {
    stage('Example') {
      steps {
          /* WRONG! */
          bat "echo ${EXAMPLE_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

groovyCopied!

Here, the `bat` step receives `echo sec%ret` and the Windows batch shell will simply drop the `%` and print out the value `secret`.
Because there is a single character difference, the value `secret` will not be masked.
Though the value is not the same as the actual credential, this is still a significant exposure of sensitive information.
Again, single-quotes avoids this issue.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  environment {
    EXAMPLE_KEY = credentials('example-credentials-id') // Secret value is 'sec%ret'
  }
  stages {
    stage('Example') {
      steps {
          /* CORRECT */
          bat 'echo %EXAMPLE_KEY%'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Handling parameters [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#handling-parameters)

Declarative Pipeline supports parameters out-of-the-box, allowing the Pipeline to accept user-specified parameters at runtime via the [parameters directive](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#parameters).
Configuring parameters with Scripted Pipeline is done with the `properties` step, which can be found in the Snippet Generator.

If you configured your pipeline to accept parameters using the **Build with Parameters** option, those parameters are accessible as members of the `params` variable.

Assuming that a String parameter named "Greeting" has been configured in the `Jenkinsfile`, it can access that parameter via `${params.Greeting}`:

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'Greeting', defaultValue: 'Hello', description: 'How should I greet the world?')
    }
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            steps {
                echo "${params.Greeting} World!"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Handling failure [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#handling-failure)

Declarative Pipeline supports robust failure handling by default via its [post section](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post) which allows declaring a number of different "post conditions" such as: `always`, `unstable`, `success`, `failure`, and `changed`.
The [Pipeline Syntax](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post) section provides more detail on how to use the various post conditions.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'make check'
            }

            junit '**/target/*.xml'
        }
    }
    /* .. snip .. */
}

groovyCopied!

Scripted Pipeline however relies on Groovy’s built-in `try`/ `catch`/ `finally` semantics for handling failures during execution of the Pipeline.

In the [Test](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#test) example above, the `sh` step was modified to never return a non-zero exit code ( `sh 'make check || true'`).
This approach, while valid, means the following stages need to check `currentBuild.result` to know if there has been a test failure or not.

An alternative way of handling this, which preserves the early-exit behavior of failures in Pipeline, while still giving `junit` the chance to capture test reports, is to use a series of `try`/ `finally` blocks:

### Using multiple agents [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#using-multiple-agents)

In all the previous examples, only a single agent has been used.
This means Jenkins will allocate an executor wherever one is available, regardless of how it is labeled or configured.
Not only can this behavior be overridden, but Pipeline allows utilizing multiple agents in the Jenkins environment from within the _same_ `Jenkinsfile`, which can be helpful for more advanced use-cases such as executing builds/tests across multiple platforms.

In the example below, the "Build" stage will be performed on one agent and the built results will be reused on two subsequent agents, labelled "linux" and "windows" respectively, during the "Test" stage.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            agent any
            steps {
                checkout scm
                sh 'make'
                stash includes: '**/target/*.jar', name: 'app' (1)
            }
        }
        stage('Test on Linux') {
            agent { (2)
                label 'linux'
            }
            steps {
                unstash 'app' (3)
                sh 'make check'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit '**/target/*.xml'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Test on Windows') {
            agent {
                label 'windows'
            }
            steps {
                unstash 'app'
                bat 'make check' (4)
            }

### Optional step arguments [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#optional-step-arguments)

Pipeline follows the Groovy language convention of allowing parentheses to be omitted around method arguments.

Many Pipeline steps also use the named-parameter syntax as a shorthand for creating a Map in Groovy, which uses the syntax `[key1: value1, key2: value2]`.
Making statements like the following functionally equivalent:

```
git url: 'git://example.com/amazing-project.git', branch: 'master'
git([url: 'git://example.com/amazing-project.git', branch: 'master'])
```

groovyCopied!

For convenience, when calling steps taking only one parameter (or only one mandatory parameter), the parameter name may be omitted, for example:

```
sh 'echo hello' /* short form  */
sh([script: 'echo hello'])  /* long form */
```

### Advanced Scripted Pipeline [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#advanced-scripted-pipeline)

Scripted Pipeline is a domain-specific language \[ [3](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#_footnotedef_3 "View footnote.")\] based on Groovy, most [Groovy syntax](http://groovy-lang.org/semantics.html) can be used in Scripted Pipeline without modification.

#### Parallel execution [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/\#parallel-execution)

The example in the [section above](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#using-multiple-agents) runs tests across two different platforms in a linear series.
In practice, if the `make check` execution takes 30 minutes to complete, the "Test" stage would now take 60 minutes to complete!

Fortunately, Pipeline has built-in functionality for executing portions of Scripted Pipeline in parallel, implemented in the aptly named `parallel` step.

Refactoring the example above to use the `parallel` step:

Jenkinsfile (Scripted Pipeline)

```groovy
stage('Build') {
    /* .. snip .. */
}

stage('Test') {
    parallel linux: {
        node('linux') {
            checkout scm
            try {
                unstash 'app'
                sh 'make check'
            }
            finally {
                junit '**/target/*.xml'
            }
        }
    },
    windows: {
        node('windows') {
            /* .. snip .. */
        }
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

Instead of executing the tests on the "linux" and "windows" labelled nodes in series, they will now execute in parallel assuming the requisite capacity exists in the Jenkins environment.

As Pipeline is adopted for more and more projects in an organization, common
patterns are likely to emerge. Oftentimes it is useful to share parts of
Pipelines between various projects to reduce redundancies and keep code
"DRY"
\[ [1](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")\].

Pipeline has support for creating "Shared Libraries" which can be defined in
external source control repositories and loaded into existing Pipelines.

## Defining Shared Libraries [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#defining-shared-libraries)

A Shared Library is defined with a name, a source code retrieval method such
as by SCM, and optionally a default version. The name should be a short
identifier as it will be used in scripts.

The version could be anything understood by that SCM; for example, branches,
tags, and commit hashes all work for Git. You may also declare whether scripts
need to explicitly request that library (detailed below), or if it is present
by default. Furthermore, if you specify a version in Jenkins configuration,
you can block scripts from selecting a _different_ version.

The best way to specify the SCM is using an SCM plugin which has been
specifically updated to support a new API for checking out an arbitrary named
version ( _Modern SCM_ option). As of this writing, the latest versions of the
Git and Subversion plugins support this mode; others should follow.

If your SCM plugin has not been integrated, you may select _Legacy SCM_ and
pick anything offered. In this case, you need to include
`${library.yourLibName.version}` somewhere in the configuration of the SCM, so
that during checkout the plugin will expand this variable to select the desired
version. For example, for Subversion, you can set the _Repository URL_ to
`svnserver/project/${library.yourLibName.version}` and then use
versions such as `trunk` or `branches/dev` or `tags/1.0`.

### Directory structure [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#directory-structure)

The directory structure of a Shared Library repository is as follows:

```
(root)
+- src                     # Groovy source files
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- Bar.groovy  # for org.foo.Bar class
+- vars
|   +- foo.groovy          # for global 'foo' variable
|   +- foo.txt             # help for 'foo' variable
+- resources               # resource files (external libraries only)
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- bar.json    # static helper data for org.foo.Bar
```

Copied!

The `src` directory should look like standard Java source directory structure.
This directory is added to the classpath when executing Pipelines.

The `vars` directory hosts script files that are exposed as a variable in Pipelines. The name of the file is the name of the variable in the Pipeline.
So if you had a file called `vars/log.groovy` with a function like `def info(message)…​` in it, you can access this function like `log.info "hello world"` in the Pipeline. You can put as many functions as you like inside this file. Read on below for more examples and options.

The basename of each `.groovy` file should be a Groovy (~ Java) identifier, conventionally `camelCased`.
The matching `.txt`, if present, can contain documentation, processed through the system’s configured [markup formatter](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Markup+formatting) (so may really be HTML, Markdown, etc., though the `.txt` extension is required). This documentation will only be visible on the [Global Variable Reference](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#global-variable-reference) pages that are accessed from the navigation sidebar of Pipeline jobs that import the shared library. In addition, those jobs must run successfully once before the shared library documentation will be generated.

The Groovy source files in these directories get the same “CPS transformation”
as in Scripted Pipeline.

A `resources` directory allows the `libraryResource` step to be used from an external library to load associated non-Groovy files.
Currently this feature is not supported for internal libraries.

Other directories under the root are reserved for future enhancements.

### Global Shared Libraries [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#global-shared-libraries)

There are several places where Shared Libraries can be defined, depending on
the use-case.
Navigate to **_Manage Jenkins » System » Global Trusted Pipeline Libraries_** to configure as many libraries as necessary.

![Jenkins System Configuration page, accessed by navigating from Dashboard to Manage Jenkins then to System, displaying sections for Global Trusted Pipeline Libraries and Global Untrusted Pipeline Libraries. Each section provides options to add sharable libraries.](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/resources/pipeline/add-global-pipeline-libraries.png)

Since these libraries will be globally usable, any Pipeline in the system can
utilize functionality implemented in these libraries.

These libraries may be marked “trusted“, meaning they can run any methods in Java,
Groovy, Jenkins internal APIs, Jenkins plugins, or third-party libraries.
This allows you to define libraries that encapsulate individually unsafe APIs in a
higher-level wrapper that is safe for use from any pipeline.
Beware that **anyone able to push commits to this SCM repository could obtain unlimited access to Jenkins**.
You need the _Overall/RunScripts_ permission to configure these libraries (normally this will be granted to Jenkins administrators).

If you only have _Overall/Manage_ permission, you can still configure global libraries,
but only “untrusted” ones that run in the Groovy sandbox just like typical Pipeline scripts.

### Folder-level Shared Libraries [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#folder-level-shared-libraries)

Any Folder created can have Shared Libraries associated with it. This mechanism
allows scoping of specific libraries to all the Pipelines inside of the folder
or subfolder.

Folder-scoped libraries are always “untrusted”.

### Automatic Shared Libraries [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#automatic-shared-libraries)

Other plugins may add ways of defining libraries on the fly. For example, the
[Pipeline: GitHub Groovy Libraries](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-github-lib) plugin
allows a script to use an untrusted library
named like `github.com/someorg/somerepo` without any additional configuration. In
this case, the specified GitHub repository would be loaded, from the `master`
branch, using an anonymous checkout.

## Using libraries [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#using-libraries)

Shared Libraries marked _Load implicitly_ allows Pipelines to immediately use
classes or global variables defined by any such libraries. To access other
shared libraries, the `Jenkinsfile` needs to use the `@Library` annotation,
specifying the library’s name:

![Jenkins System Configuration page accessed by navigating from Dashboard to Manage Jenkins then to System, displaying options to configure a Global Trusted Pipeline Library. It includes fields for the library name, default version, checkboxes for 'Allow the default version to be overridden' and 'Include @Library changes in job recent changes' are checked, and a dropdown to select the retrieval method (Modern SCM or Legacy SCM) is shown.](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/resources/pipeline/configure-global-pipeline-library.png)

```
@Library('my-shared-library') _
/* Using a version specifier, such as branch, tag, etc */
@Library('my-shared-library@1.0') _
/* Accessing multiple libraries with one statement */
@Library(['my-shared-library', 'otherlib@abc1234']) _
```

groovyCopied!

The annotation can be anywhere in the script where an annotation is permitted
by Groovy. When referring to class libraries (with `src/` directories),
conventionally the annotation goes on an `import` statement:

```
@Library('somelib')
import com.mycorp.pipeline.somelib.UsefulClass
```

groovyCopied!

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | For Shared Libraries which only define Global Variables ( `vars/`), or a<br>`Jenkinsfile` which only needs a Global Variable, the<br>[annotation](http://groovy-lang.org/objectorientation.html#_annotation)<br>pattern `@Library('my-shared-library') _` may be useful for keeping code<br>concise. In essence, instead of annotating an unnecessary `import` statement,<br>the symbol `_` is annotated.<br>It is not recommended to `import` a global variable/function,<br>since this will force the compiler to interpret fields and methods as `static`<br>even if they were intended to be customized.<br>The Groovy compiler in this case can produce confusing error messages. |

Libraries are resolved and loaded during _compilation_ of the script,
before it starts executing. This allows the Groovy compiler to understand the
meaning of symbols used in static type checking, and permits them to be used
in type declarations in the script, for example:

```
@Library('somelib')
import com.mycorp.pipeline.somelib.Helper

int useSomeLib(Helper helper) {
    helper.prepare()
    return helper.count()
}

echo useSomeLib(new Helper('some text'))
```

groovyCopied!

Global Variables however, are resolved at runtime.

### Loading libraries dynamically [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#loading-libraries-dynamically)

As of version 2.7 of the _Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries_ plugin,
there is a new option for loading (non-implicit) libraries in a script:
a `library` step that loads a library _dynamically_, at any time during the build.

If you are only interested in using global variables/functions (from the `vars/` directory),
the syntax is quite simple:

```
library 'my-shared-library'
```

groovyCopied!

Thereafter, any global variables from that library will be accessible to the script.

Using classes from the `src/` directory is also possible, but trickier.
Whereas the `@Library` annotation prepares the “classpath” of the script prior to compilation,
by the time a `library` step is encountered the script has already been compiled.
Therefore you cannot `import` or otherwise “statically” refer to types from the library.

However you may use library classes dynamically (without type checking),
accessing them by fully-qualified name from the return value of the `library` step.
`static` methods can be invoked using a Java-like syntax:

```
library('my-shared-library').com.mycorp.pipeline.Utils.someStaticMethod()
```

groovyCopied!

You can also access `static` fields, and call constructors as if they were `static` methods named `new`:

```
def useSomeLib(helper) { // dynamic: cannot declare as Helper
    helper.prepare()
    return helper.count()
}

def lib = library('my-shared-library').com.mycorp.pipeline // preselect the package

echo useSomeLib(lib.Helper.new(lib.Constants.SOME_TEXT))
```

groovyCopied!

### Library versions [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#library-versions)

The "Default version" for a configured Shared Library is used when "Load
implicitly" is checked, or if a Pipeline references the library only by name,
for example `@Library('my-shared-library') _`. If a "Default version" is **not**
defined, the Pipeline must specify a version, for example
`@Library('my-shared-library@master') _`.

If "Allow default version to be overridden" is enabled in the Shared Library’s
configuration, a `@Library` annotation may also override a default version
defined for the library. This also allows a library with "Load implicitly" to
be loaded from a different version if necessary.

When using the `library` step you may also specify a version:

```
library 'my-shared-library@master'
```

groovyCopied!

Since this is a regular step, that version could be _computed_
rather than a constant as with the annotation; for example:

```
library "my-shared-library@$BRANCH_NAME"
```

groovyCopied!

would load a library using the same SCM branch as the multibranch `Jenkinsfile`.
As another example, you could pick a library by parameter:

```
properties([parameters([string(name: 'LIB_VERSION', defaultValue: 'master')])])
library "my-shared-library@${params.LIB_VERSION}"
```

groovyCopied!

Note that the `library` step may not be used to override the version of an implicitly loaded library.
It is already loaded by the time the script starts, and a library of a given name may not be loaded twice.

### Retrieval Method [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#retrieval-method)

The best way to specify the SCM is using an SCM plugin which has been
specifically updated to support a new API for checking out an arbitrary named
version ( **Modern SCM** option). As of this writing, the latest versions of the
Git and Subversion plugins support this mode.

![Jenkins System Configuration page accessed by navigating from the Dashboard to Manage Jenkins, then to System, showing settings for adding a Global Trusted Pipeline Library. It includes options as follows: the library name is set to 'my-shared-library', the default version to 'main', and checkboxes for 'Allow default version to be overridden' and 'Include @Library changes in job recent changes' are checked. The retrieval method is set to Modern SCM, with the source code management field set to 'Git' including options such as project repository, credentials, and behaviors like branch discovery.](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/resources/pipeline/global-pipeline-library-modern-scm.png)

#### Legacy SCM [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#legacy-scm)

SCM plugins which have not yet been updated to support the newer features
required by Shared Libraries, may still be used via the **Legacy SCM** option.
In this case, include `${library.yourlibrarynamehere.version}` wherever a
branch/tag/ref may be configured for that particular SCM plugin. This ensures
that during checkout of the library’s source code, the SCM plugin will expand
this variable to checkout the appropriate version of the library.

![Jenkins System Configuration page accessed by navigating from the Dashboard to Manage Jenkins, then to System, showing settings for adding a Global Trusted Pipeline Library. It includes options as follows: the library name is set to 'my-shared-library', the default version to 'Stable', and checkboxes for 'Allow default version to be overridden','Include @Library changes in job recent changes' and 'Cache fetched versions on the controller for quick retrieval' are checked. The 'Cache refresh time in minutes' is set to 37. The retrieval method is set to Legacy SCM, with the source code management field set to 'Subversion'.

#### Dynamic retrieval [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#dynamic-retrieval)

If you only specify a library name (optionally with version after `@`) in the `library` step,
Jenkins will look for a preconfigured library of that name.
(Or in the case of a `github.com/owner/repo` automatic library it will load that.)

But you may also specify the retrieval method dynamically,
in which case there is no need for the library to have been predefined in Jenkins.
Here is an example:

```
library identifier: 'custom-lib@master', retriever: modernSCM(
  [$class: 'GitSCMSource',\
   remote: 'git@git.mycorp.com:my-jenkins-utils.git',\
   credentialsId: 'my-private-key'])
```

It is best to refer to **Pipeline Syntax** for the precise syntax for your SCM.

Note that the library version _must_ be specified in these cases.

## Writing libraries [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#writing-libraries)

At the base level, any valid
[Groovy code](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html)
is okay for use. Different data structures, utility methods, etc, such as:

```
// src/org/foo/Point.groovy
package org.foo

// point in 3D space
class Point {
  float x,y,z
}
```

groovyCopied!

### Accessing steps [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#accessing-steps)

Library classes cannot directly call steps such as `sh` or `git`.
They can however implement methods, outside of the scope of an enclosing
class, which in turn invoke Pipeline steps, for example:

```
// src/org/foo/Zot.groovy
package org.foo

def checkOutFrom(repo) {
  git url: "git@github.com:jenkinsci/${repo}"
}

return this
```

groovyCopied!

Which can then be called from a Scripted Pipeline:

```
def z = new org.foo.Zot()
z.checkOutFrom(repo)
```

groovyCopied!

This approach has limitations; for example, it prevents the declaration of a
superclass.

Alternately, a set of `steps` can be passed explicitly using `this` to a library class, in a
constructor, or just one method:

```
package org.foo
class Utilities implements Serializable {
  def steps
  Utilities(steps) {this.steps = steps}
  def mvn(args) {
    steps.sh "${steps.tool 'Maven'}/bin/mvn -o ${args}"
  }
}
```

groovyCopied!

When saving state on classes, such as above, the class **must** implement the
`Serializable` interface. This ensures that a Pipeline using the class, as seen
in the example below, can properly suspend and resume in Jenkins.

```
@Library('utils') import org.foo.Utilities
def utils = new Utilities(this)
node {
  utils.mvn 'clean package'
}
```

groovyCopied!

If the library needs to access global variables, such as `env`, those should be
explicitly passed into the library classes, or methods, in a similar manner.

Instead of passing numerous variables from the Scripted Pipeline into a library,

```
package org.foo
class Utilities {
  static def mvn(script, args) {
    script.sh "${script.tool 'Maven'}/bin/mvn -s ${script.env.HOME}/jenkins.xml -o ${args}"
  }
}
```

groovyCopied!

The above example shows the script being passed in to one `static` method,
invoked from a Scripted Pipeline as follows:

```
@Library('utils') import static org.foo.Utilities.*
node {
  mvn this, 'clean package'
}
```

groovyCopied!

### Defining global variables [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#defining-global-variables)

Internally, scripts in the `vars` directory are instantiated on-demand as
singletons. This allows multiple methods to be defined in a
single `.groovy` file for convenience. For example:

vars/log.groovy

```
def info(message) {
    echo "INFO: ${message}"
}

def warning(message) {
    echo "WARNING: ${message}"
}
```

groovyCopied!

Jenkinsfile

```
@Library('utils') _

log.info 'Starting'
log.warning 'Nothing to do!'
```

groovyCopied!

Declarative Pipeline does not allow method calls on objects outside "script" blocks.
( [JENKINS-42360](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-42360)).
The method calls above would need to be put inside a `script` directive:

Jenkinsfile

```
@Library('utils') _

pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage ('Example') {
            steps {
                // log.info 'Starting' (1)
                script { (2)
                    log.info 'Starting'
                    log.warning 'Nothing to do!'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

|     |     |

| **1** | This method call would fail because it is outside a `script` directive. |
| **2** | `script` directive required to access global variables in Declarative Pipeline. |

| --- | --- |
|  | A variable defined in a shared library will only show up in _Global Variables_<br>_Reference_ (under _Pipeline Syntax_) after Jenkins loads and uses that library<br>as part of a successful Pipeline run. |

|     |     |

Though using fields for global variables is discouraged as per above, it is possible to define fields and use them as read-only.
To define a field you need to use an annotation:

```
@groovy.transform.Field
def yourField = "YourConstantValue"

def yourFunction....
```

### Defining custom steps [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#defining-custom-steps)

Shared Libraries can also define global variables which behave similarly to
built-in steps, such as `sh` or `git`. Global variables defined in Shared
Libraries **must** be named with all lowercase or "camelCased" in order to be
loaded properly by Pipeline.
\[ [2](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#_footnotedef_2 "View footnote.")\]

For example, to define `sayHello`, the file `vars/sayHello.groovy`
should be created and should implement a `call` method. The `call` method
allows the global variable to be invoked in a manner similar to a step:

```
// vars/sayHello.groovy
def call(String name = 'human') {
    // Any valid steps can be called from this code, just like in other
    // Scripted Pipeline
    echo "Hello, ${name}."
}
```

groovyCopied!

The Pipeline would then be able to reference and invoke this variable:

```
sayHello 'Joe'
sayHello() /* invoke with default arguments */
```

groovyCopied!

If called with a block, the `call` method will receive a
[`Closure`](http://groovy-lang.org/closures.html).
The type should be defined explicitly to clarify the intent of the step, for
example:

```
// vars/windows.groovy
def call(Closure body) {
    node('windows') {
        body()
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

The Pipeline can then use this variable like any built-in step which
accepts a block:

```
windows {
    bat "cmd /?"
}
```

groovyCopied!

### Defining a more structured DSL [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#defining-a-more-structured-dsl)

If you have a lot of Pipelines that are mostly similar, the global
variable mechanism provides a handy tool to build a higher-level DSL
that captures the similarity. For example, all Jenkins plugins are built and
tested in the same way, so we might write a step named
`buildPlugin`:

```
// vars/buildPlugin.groovy
def call(Map config) {
    node {
        git url: "https://github.com/jenkinsci/${config.name}-plugin.git"
        sh 'mvn install'
        mail to: '...', subject: "${config.name} plugin build", body: '...'
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

Assuming the script has either been loaded as a
[Global Shared Library](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#global-shared-libraries) or as a
[Folder-level Shared Library](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/#folder-level-shared-libraries)
the resulting `Jenkinsfile` will be dramatically simpler:

Jenkinsfile (Scripted Pipeline)

```groovy
buildPlugin name: 'git'
```

groovyCopied!

There is also a “builder pattern” trick using Groovy’s `Closure.DELEGATE_FIRST`,
which permits `Jenkinsfile` to look slightly more like a configuration file than a program,
but this is more complex and error-prone and is not recommended.

### Using third-party libraries [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#using-third-party-libraries)

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | While possible, accessing third-party libraries using `@Grab` from trusted libraries has various issues and is not recommended.<br>Instead of using `@Grab`, the recommended approach is to create a standalone executable in the programming language of your choice (using whatever third-party libraries you desire), install it on the Jenkins agents that your Pipelines use, and then invoke that executable in your Pipelines using the `bat` or `sh` step. |

It is possible to use third-party Java libraries, typically found in
[Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/),
from **trusted** library code using the `@Grab` annotation. Refer to the
[Grape documentation](https://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/grape.html#_quick_start)
for details, but simply put:

```
@Grab('org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.4.1')
import org.apache.commons.math3.primes.Primes
void parallelize(int count) {
  if (!Primes.isPrime(count)) {
    error "${count} was not prime"
  }
  // …
}
```

groovyCopied!

Third-party libraries are cached by default in `~/.groovy/grapes/` on the
Jenkins controller.

### Loading resources [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#loading-resources)

External libraries may load adjunct files from a `resources/` directory using
the `libraryResource` step. The argument is a relative pathname, akin to Java
resource loading:

```
def request = libraryResource 'com/mycorp/pipeline/somelib/request.json'
```

groovyCopied!

The file is loaded as a string, suitable for passing to certain APIs or saving
to a workspace using `writeFile`.

It is advisable to use an unique package structure so you do not accidentally
conflict with another library.

### Pretesting library changes [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#pretesting-library-changes)

If you notice a mistake in a build using an untrusted library,
simply click the _Replay_ link to try editing one or more of its source files,
and see if the resulting build behaves as expected.
Once you are satisfied with the result, follow the diff link from the build’s status page,
and apply the diff to the library repository and commit.

(Even if the version requested for the library was a branch, rather than a fixed version like a tag,
replayed builds will use the exact same revision as the original build:
library sources will not be checked out again.)

_Replay_ is not currently supported for trusted libraries.
Modifying resource files is also not currently supported during _Replay_.

### Defining Declarative Pipelines [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#defining-declarative-pipelines)

Starting with Declarative 1.2, released in late September, 2017, you can define
Declarative Pipelines in your shared libraries as well. Here’s an example,
which will execute a different Declarative Pipeline depending on whether the
build number is odd or even:

```
// vars/evenOrOdd.groovy
def call(int buildNumber) {
  if (buildNumber % 2 == 0) {
    pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
        stage('Even Stage') {
          steps {
            echo "The build number is even"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  } else {
    pipeline {
      agent any
      stages {
        stage('Odd Stage') {
          steps {
            echo "The build number is odd"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

groovyCopied!

```
// Jenkinsfile
@Library('my-shared-library') _

evenOrOdd(currentBuild.getNumber())
```

groovyCopied!

Only entire `pipeline` s can be defined in shared libraries as of this time.
This can only be done in `vars/*.groovy`, and only in a `call` method. Only one
Declarative Pipeline can be executed in a single build, and if you attempt to
execute a second one, your build will fail as a result.

### Testing library pull request changes [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/\#testing-library-pull-request-changes)

By adding `@Library('my-shared-library@pull/<your-pr-number>/head') _` at the top of a library consumer Jenkinsfile, you can test your pipeline library pull request changes _in situ_ if your pipeline library is hosted on GitHub and the SCM configuration for the pipeline library uses GitHub.

Refer to the pull request or merge request branch naming convention for other providers like Assembla, Bitbucket, Gitea, GitLab, and Tuleap.

Take, for example, a change to the global ci.jenkins.io shared pipeline, which has its source code stored at [github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/).

Let’s say you’re writing a new feature and opened a pull request on the pipeline library, number `123`.

By opening a pull request on [the dedicated `jenkins-infra-test-plugin` test repository](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-infra-test-plugin/) with the following content, you’ll be able to check your changes on ci.jenkins.io:

```
--- jenkins-infra-test-plugin/Jenkinsfile
+++ jenkins-infra-test-plugin/Jenkinsfile
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
+ @Library('pipeline-library@pull/123/head') _
  buildPlugin(
    useContainerAgent: true,
    configurations: [\
      [platform: 'linux', jdk: 21],\
      [platform: 'windows', jdk: 17],\
  ])
```

Many organizations use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to unify their build and test environments across machines, and to provide an efficient mechanism for deploying applications.
Starting with Pipeline versions 2.5 and higher, Pipeline has built-in support for interacting with Docker from within a `Jenkinsfile`.

While this page covers the basics of utilizing Docker from within a `Jenkinsfile`, it will not cover the fundamentals of Docker, which you can refer to in the [Docker Getting Started Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

## Customizing the execution environment [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#execution-environment)

Pipeline is designed to easily use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) images as the execution environment for a single [Stage](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/#stage) or the entire Pipeline.
Meaning that a user can define the tools required for their Pipeline, without having to manually configure agents.
Any tool that can be [packaged in a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/) can be used with ease, by making only minor edits to a `Jenkinsfile`.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'node:22.17.0-alpine3.22' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'node --eval "console.log(process.platform,process.env.CI)"'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Additional arguments [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#additional-arguments)

Additional arguments, such as the `registryUrl`, are described in the [agent parameters](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#agent-parameters) syntax documentation.

### Workspace synchronization [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#workspace-synchronization)

If it is important to keep the workspace synchronized with other stages, use `reuseNode true`.
Otherwise, a dockerized stage can be run on the same agent or any other agent, but in a temporary workspace.

By default, for a containerized stage, Jenkins:

- Picks an agent.

- Creates a new empty workspace.

- Clones pipeline code into it.

- Mounts this new workspace into the container.


If you have multiple Jenkins agents, your containerized stage can be started on any of them.

When `reuseNode` is set to `true`, no new workspace will be created, and the current workspace from the current agent will be mounted into the container.
After this, the container will be started on the same node, so all of the data will be synchronized.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            agent {
                docker {
                    image 'gradle:8.14.0-jdk21-alpine'
                    // Run the container on the node specified at the
                    // top-level of the Pipeline, in the same workspace,
                    // rather than on a new node entirely:
                    reuseNode true
                }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'gradle -g gradle-user-home --version'
            }
        }
    }
}

### Caching data for containers [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#caching-data-for-containers)

Many build tools will download external dependencies and cache them locally for future re-use.
Since containers are initially created with "clean" file systems, this can result in slower Pipelines, as they may not take advantage of on-disk caches between subsequent Pipeline runs.

Pipeline supports adding custom arguments that are passed to Docker, allowing users to specify custom [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/) to mount, which can be used for caching data on the [agent](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/#agent) between Pipeline runs.
The following example will cache `~/.m2` between Pipeline runs utilizing the [`maven` container](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven/), avoiding the need to re-download dependencies for subsequent Pipeline runs.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-21'
            args '-v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B'
            }
        }
    }
}

### Using multiple containers [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#using-multiple-containers)

It has become increasingly common for code bases to rely on multiple different technologies.
For example, a repository might have both a Java-based back-end API implementation _and_ a JavaScript-based front-end implementation.
Combining Docker and Pipeline allows a `Jenkinsfile` to use **multiple** types of technologies, by combining the `agent {}` directive with different stages.

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Back-end') {
            agent {
                docker { image 'maven:3.9.10-eclipse-temurin-21-alpine' }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'mvn --version'
            }
        }
        stage('Front-end') {
            agent {
                docker { image 'node:22.17.0-alpine3.22' }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'node --version'
            }
        }
    }
}

### Using a Dockerfile [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#dockerfile)

For projects requiring a more customized execution environment, Pipeline also supports building and running a container from a `Dockerfile` in the source repository.
In contrast to the [previous approach](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/#execution-environment) of using an "off-the-shelf" container, using the `agent { dockerfile true }` syntax builds a new image from a `Dockerfile`, rather than pulling one from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

Reusing an example from above, with a more custom `Dockerfile`:

Dockerfile

```
FROM node:22.17.0-alpine3.22

RUN apk add -U subversion
```

Copied!

By committing this to the root of the source repository, the `Jenkinsfile` can be changed to build a container based on this `Dockerfile`, and then run the defined steps using that container:

Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent { dockerfile true }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'node --version'
                sh 'svn --version'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

The `agent { dockerfile true }` syntax supports a number of other options, which are described in more detail in the [Pipeline Syntax](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent) section.

### Specifying a Docker Label [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#specifying-a-docker-label)

By default, Pipeline assumes that _any_ configured [agent](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/#agent) is capable of running Docker-based Pipelines.
For Jenkins environments that have macOS, Windows, or other agents that are unable to run the Docker daemon, this default setting may be problematic.
Pipeline provides a global option on the **Manage Jenkins** page and on the [Folder](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/#folder) level, for specifying which agents (by [Label](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/glossary/#label)) to use for running Docker-based Pipelines. To enable this option for Docker labels, the [**Docker Pipeline**](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-workflow) plugin must be installed.

![Navigate from Dashboard to Manage Jenkins then to System. In the 'Declarative Pipeline (Docker)' section set the Docker label, Docker Registry URL and Registry Credentials.](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/resources/pipeline/configure-docker-label.png)

### Path setup for mac OS users [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#path-setup-for-mac-os-users)

The `/usr/local/bin` directory is not included in the macOS `PATH` for Docker images by default.
If executables from `/usr/local/bin` need to be called from within Jenkins, the `PATH` needs to be extended to include `/usr/local/bin`.
Add a path node in the file "/usr/local/Cellar/jenkins-lts/XXX/homebrew.mxcl.jenkins-lts.plist" like this:

Contents of homebrew.mxcl.jenkins-lts.plist

```
<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
<dict>
<key>PATH</key>
<string><!-- insert revised path here --></string>
</dict>
```

xmlCopied!

The revised `PATH` `string` should be a colon separated list of directories in the same format as the `PATH` environment variable and should include:

- `/usr/local/bin`

- `/usr/bin`

- `/bin`

- `/usr/sbin`

- `/sbin`

- `/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/`

- `/Users/XXX/Library/Group\ Containers/group.com.docker/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin` (where `XXX` is replaced by your user name)


Now, restart jenkins using `brew services restart jenkins-lts`.

## Advanced Usage with Scripted Pipeline [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#advanced-usage-with-scripted-pipeline)

### Running "sidecar" containers [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#running-sidecar-containers)

Using Docker in Pipeline is an effective way to run a service on which the build, or a set of tests, may rely.
Similar to the [sidecar pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar), Docker Pipeline can run one container "in the background", while performing work in another.
Utilizing this sidecar approach, a Pipeline can have a "clean" container provisioned for each Pipeline run.

Consider a hypothetical integration test suite that relies on a local MySQL database to be running.
Using the `withRun` method, implemented in the [Docker Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-workflow) plugin’s support for Scripted Pipeline, a `Jenkinsfile` can run MySQL as a sidecar:

```
node {
    checkout scm
    /*
     * In order to communicate with the MySQL server, this Pipeline explicitly
     * maps the port (`3306`) to a known port on the host machine.
     */
    docker.image('mysql:8-oracle').withRun('-e "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw"' +
                                           ' -p 3306:3306') { c ->
        /* Wait until mysql service is up */
        sh 'while ! mysqladmin ping -h0.0.0.0 --silent; do sleep 1; done'
        /* Run some tests which require MySQL */
        sh 'make check'
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

This example can be taken further, utilizing two containers simultaneously.
One "sidecar" running MySQL, and another providing the [execution environment](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/#execution-environment) by using the Docker [container links](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/).

```
node {
    checkout scm
    docker.image('mysql:8-oracle').withRun('-e "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw"') { c ->
        docker.image('mysql:8-oracle').inside("--link ${c.id}:db") {
            /* Wait until mysql service is up */
            sh 'while ! mysqladmin ping -hdb --silent; do sleep 1; done'
        }
        docker.image('oraclelinux:9').inside("--link ${c.id}:db") {
            /*
             * Run some tests that require MySQL, and assume that it is
             * available on the host name `db`
             */
            sh 'make check'
        }
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

The above example uses the object exposed by `withRun`, which has the running container’s ID available via the `id` property.
Using the container’s ID, the Pipeline can create a link by passing custom Docker arguments to the `inside()` method.

The `id` property can also be useful for inspecting logs from a running Docker container before the Pipeline exits:

```
sh "docker logs ${c.id}"
```

groovyCopied!

### Building containers [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#building-containers)

In order to create a Docker image, the [Docker Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-workflow) plugin also provides a `build()` method for creating a new image from a `Dockerfile` in the repository during a Pipeline run.

One major benefit of using the syntax `docker.build("my-image-name")` is that a Scripted Pipeline can use the return value for subsequent Docker Pipeline calls, for example:

```
node {
    checkout scm

    def customImage = docker.build("my-image:${env.BUILD_ID}")

    customImage.inside {
        sh 'make test'
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

The return value can also be used to publish the Docker image to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) or a [custom Registry](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/#custom-registry), via the `push()` method, for example:

```
node {
    checkout scm
    def customImage = docker.build("my-image:${env.BUILD_ID}")
    customImage.push()
}
```

groovyCopied!

One common usage of image "tags" is to specify a `latest` tag for the most recently validated version of a Docker image.
The `push()` method accepts an optional `tag` parameter, allowing the Pipeline to push the `customImage` with different tags, for example:

```
node {
    checkout scm
    def customImage = docker.build("my-image:${env.BUILD_ID}")
    customImage.push()

    customImage.push('latest')
}
```

groovyCopied!

The `build()` method builds the `Dockerfile` in the current directory by default.
This can be overridden by providing a directory path containing a `Dockerfile` as the second argument of the `build()` method, for example:

```
node {
    checkout scm
    def testImage = docker.build("test-image", "./dockerfiles/test") (1)

    testImage.inside {
        sh 'make test'
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Builds `test-image` from the Dockerfile found at `./dockerfiles/test/Dockerfile`. |

It is possible to pass other arguments to [`docker build`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) by adding them to the second argument of the `build()` method.
When passing arguments this way, the last value in the string must be the path to the docker file, and should end with the folder to use as the build context.

This example overrides the default `Dockerfile` by passing the `-f` flag:

```
node {
    checkout scm
    def dockerfile = 'Dockerfile.test'
    def customImage = docker.build("my-image:${env.BUILD_ID}",
                                   "-f ${dockerfile} ./dockerfiles") (1)
}
```

groovyCopied!

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Builds `my-image:${env.BUILD_ID}` from the Dockerfile found at `./dockerfiles/Dockerfile.test`. |

### Using a remote Docker server [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#using-a-remote-docker-server)

By default, the [Docker Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-workflow) plugin will communicate with a local Docker daemon, typically accessed through `/var/run/docker.sock`.

To select a non-default Docker server, such as with [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/), use the `withServer()` method.

You can pass a URI, and optionally the Credentials ID of a **Docker Server Certificate Authentication** pre-configured in Jenkins, to the method with:

```
node {
    checkout scm

    docker.withServer('tcp://swarm.example.com:2376', 'swarm-certs') {
        docker.image('mysql:8-oracle').withRun('-p 3306:3306') {
            /* do things */
        }
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

### Using a custom registry [Anchor](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/\#custom-registry)

By default, the [Docker Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-workflow) plugin assumes the default Docker Registry of [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

In order to use a custom Docker Registry, users of Scripted Pipeline can wrap steps with the `withRegistry()` method, passing in the custom Registry URL, for example:

```
node {
    checkout scm

    docker.withRegistry('https://registry.example.com') {

        docker.image('my-custom-image').inside {
            sh 'make test'
        }
    }
}
```

groovyCopied!

For a Docker Registry requiring authentication, add a "Username/Password" Credentials item from the Jenkins home page and use the Credentials ID as a second argument to `withRegistry()`:

```
node {
    checkout scm

    docker.withRegistry('https://registry.example.com', 'credentials-id') {

        def customImage = docker.build("my-image:${env.BUILD_ID}")

        /* Push the container to the custom Registry */
        customImage.push()
    }
}
```

## Features [features permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-features)

This plugin lets you automate a number of Android-related tasks during a build:

- Creating a new Android emulator
  - Its configuration can be parameterised, including OS version, screen size, locale and hardware properties
  - Android SDK dependencies are automatically downloaded and installed
- Running any Android emulator
  - Waits until the emulator is fully started-up
  - Emulator snapshots can be automatically created
    - This allows a very fast startup time for subsequent builds
    - This ensures subsequent builds will start from the same clean state
  - Logs are automatically captured and saved
  - Emulator will be shut down automatically when the build has finished
  - Multiple instances of the same emulator are prevented from running concurrently
- Detecting which Android platforms are required to build one or more projects and installing them automatically
- Generating Ant build files for any app, test or library projects found in the workspace
- Installing an Android package onto an emulator
- Uninstalling an Android package from an emulator
- Running the `monkey` stress-testing tool
- Parsing output from running `monkey`
  - The build outcome can be automatically marked as unstable or failed in case a monkey-induced crash is detected

## Requirements [requirements permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-requirements)

### Jenkins [jenkins permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-jenkins)

Jenkins [version 2.479.1](https://jenkins.io/changelog/#v2.479.1) or newer is required.

### Android [android permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-android)

The plugin will automatically download and install the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/), if it's not already installed when a build starts.

This means that no manual effort is required to start running Android emulators with Jenkins.

You can, however, disable automated installation via the "Automatically install Android components when required" option on the main Jenkins configuration page.

View manual SDK installation requirements...

If you install the Android SDK yourself, you must install at least two further components, via the [Android SDK and AVD Manager](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html#components):

- SDK Tools
- SDK Platform-tools

If you only wish to run pre-existing emulator instances (aka Android Virtual Devices, or AVDs), there are no further requirements — only these two components are required.

If you want the plugin to automatically generate new emulator instances, but disable auto-installation, you must install one or more Android platform versions into the SDK.

By default, the SDK only comes with the bare minimum; in this case you will need to separately download each individual platform version you wish to build or test against.

Again, this is done via the [Android SDK and AVD Manager](https://developer.android.com/sdk/adding-components.html) tool, accessible via the command line " `android`", or via the "Window" menu in Eclipse, if you use the Eclipse ADT plugin. From the SDK Manager, you can easily install the desired " [SDK Packages](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html#components)".

## Configuration [configuration permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-configuration)

### System configuration [system configuration permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-system-configuration)

Generally no global configuration is needed — the plugin will try hard to locate an installed Android SDK whenever it is needed. If one is not found, it will be installed automatically.

See how the SDK is located...

Via the main configuration page, you can optionally specify the location where each build node can locate a copy of the Android SDK.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_global-config.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_global-config.png)

This can either be an absolute path, or can contain environment variables in the format ```$``VARIABLE_NAME```. This will be replaced at build time from the node's environment variables (see the "Node Properties" settings for each agent), or from the build's environment.

If no value is entered, or the plugin cannot find a valid SDK under the configured path, it will search under the following environment variables on the build node to try and locate a usable SDK:

- `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`
- `ANDROID_SDK_HOME`
- `ANDROID_HOME`
- `ANDROID_SDK`

If nothing is found, the plugin will search on the `PATH` to attempt to locate a usable set of SDK tools. If, after all these steps, the required Android SDK tools are not found and auto-installation is disabled, the build will be marked as "not built" and will stop.

### Job configuration [job configuration permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-job-configuration)

##### Running on headless build machines [running on headless build machines permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-running-on-headless-build-machines)

If you have build agents which are headless (e.g. Linux servers that don't have a graphical user interface), you can still run an Android Emulator even although, by default, the emulator does require a graphical environment.

Just untick the "Show emulator window" configuration option in your job configuration. This is the equivalent of using the emulator's " `-no-window`" command-line option.

Using an artificial graphical environment...

It is also possible to run the Android emulator UI on a headless build agent by making use of an artificial X server, such as [Xvnc](http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/man/Xvnc.html).

In this case, a recommended setup is to install both Xvnc and the [Xvnc Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Xvnc+Plugin) for Jenkins. With this plugin enabled in your job — and Xvnc configured to run without requesting a password — you can run multiple Android emulators in parallel on a headless agent, while keeping the "Show emulator window" option enabled.

Although the Android Emulator plugin has been designed to ensure it always runs after an Xvnc server has been started, the Xvnc plugin does not wait for the Xvnc server to be fully up-and-running before handing control over to the Android Emulator plugin.

For this reason, you may want to delay emulator startup by a few seconds (e.g. three to five), giving the Xvnc server time to finish starting-up before attempting to launch an Android emulator into it. To do so, enter the desired number of seconds in the "Startup delay" field under "Advanced" options.

##### Other requirements [other requirements permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-other-requirements)

In addition, while the Android Emulator plugin requires the [Port Allocator Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Port+Allocator+Plugin), there is no job configuration required for this; everything is handled automatically — you need not select the "Assign unique TCP ports" checkbox in the job config.

#### Selecting an emulator [selecting an emulator permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-selecting-an-emulator)

After ticking "Run an Android emulator during build", you will be asked whether you want to run an existing AVD, or whether you want to create a new one on-the-fly with certain properties.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_job-named.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_job-named.png)

Using an existing emulator for a job just requires that you enter the name of the AVD you want to be started. This AVD must exist on each build node the job will be executed on. Existing AVDs are found in your `$HOME/.android/avd` directory and can be listed using the " `android list avd`" command.

As with all other properties, you can enter environment variables here using the format ```$``VARIABLE_NAME```.

Alternatively, if you don't have a particular AVD accessible on each build node, the plugin can automatically generate a new emulator if one doesn't already exist:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_job-custom.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_job-custom.png)

Each property is mandatory, aside from the device locale. If this is not entered, the Android emulator default locale of US English (en\_US) will be used when starting the emulator.

Each field will auto-complete with the default Android SDK values, e.g. 120, 160, 240dpi densities and named screen resolutions including QVGA, HVGA, WVGA etc. However, you can enter your own values if you wish to use a custom OS image, screen density, resolution or locale.

Screen resolutions can be entered either using the named values, or as a "width times height" dimension, e.g. `480x800`.

You can specify multiple hardware properties such as the heap size for each Android app, or whether the device has a GPS by clicking the button "Add custom hardware property" and entering the values. See the inline help for more details on the values to enter.

Using Google Maps and other SDK add-ons...

As mentioned above, the "Android OS version" field will auto-complete to existing SDK versions such as "1.5" or "2.2".

However, it is possible to enter different values in this field, for example if you want to use an Android SDK add-on that you have installed, e.g. the Google APIs add-on or the Samsung GALAXY Tab add-on.

In these cases, just enter the appropriate value given by the " `android list target`" command. For example:

- The Google APIs add-on, based on an Android 1.6 emulator: `Google Inc.:Google APIs:4`
- The Samsung GALAXY Tab add-on, based on an Android 2.2 emulator: `Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.:GALAXY Tab Addon:8`

#### Multi-configuration (matrix) job [multi configuration matrix job permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-multi-configuration-matrix-job)

The real awesomeness of this plugin comes when used in conjunction with a multi-configuration job type.

By using the "Run emulator with properties" setting, in conjunction with one-or-more matrix axes and the Android Emulator plugin's variable expansion, you can generate and test with a large number of distinct Android emulator configurations with very little effort.

To give a full example, if you want to test your application across multiple Android OS versions, multiple screen densities, multiple screen resolutions and for several target locales, you might set up your matrix axes as follows:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_matrix-axes.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_matrix-axes.png)

As each of these axis names (i.e. "density", "locale", "os", "resolution") are exported by Jenkins as environment variables, you can make use of these when launching a new Android emulator:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_matrix-result.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_matrix-result.png)

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_job-variables.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_job-variables.png)

When the build executes, this would automatically generate and allow you to test your application against 64 unique device configurations.

However, you should note that not **all** combinations are valid. For example, a WVGA (800x480) resolution device makes no sense with a screen density of 120 (unless you have superhuman eyesight).

For this purpose, you can use the "Combination Filter" feature, which tells Jenkins which combinations of the matrix axes are valid. In the case of screen densities and resolutions, a configuration like this should instruct Jenkins to only build for [configurations which make sense](http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#range):

```
(density=="120").implies(resolution=="QVGA" || resolution=="WQVGA" || resolution=="FWQVGA") &&
(density=="160").implies(resolution=="HVGA" || resolution=="WVGA" || resolution=="FWVGA") &&
(density=="240").implies(resolution=="WVGA" || resolution=="FWVGA")

```

Note that each variable refers to one of the matrix axes, _not_ an Android Emulator plugin property.

## Build execution [build execution permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-build-execution)

### Environment [environment permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-environment)

For convenience, the plugin places a number of variables into the build environment relating to the emulator in use:

| Variable name | Example value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANDROID_SERIAL` | `localhost:34564` | Identifier for connecting to this AVD, e.g. `adb -s localhost:34564 shell` |
| `ANDROID_AVD_DEVICE` | `localhost:34564` | Identifier for connecting to this AVD, e.g. `adb -s localhost:34564 shell` |
| `ANDROID_AVD_ADB_PORT` | `34564` | Port used by ADB to communicate with the AVD (random for each build) |
| `ANDROID_AVD_USER_PORT` | `40960` | Port used to access the AVD's telnet user interface (random for each build) |
| `ANDROID_AVD_NAME` | `hudson_en-GB_160_HVGA_android-7` | Name of the AVD running for the build |
| `ANDROID_AVD_LOCALE` | `en_GB` | Locale of the AVD |
| `ANDROID_AVD_OS` | `2.1` | OS version of the running AVD |
| `ANDROID_AVD_DENSITY` | `160` | Screen density in dpi of the AVD |
| `ANDROID_AVD_RESOLUTION` | `HVGA` | Screen resolution, named or dimension, of the AVD |
| `ANDROID_AVD_SKIN` | `HVGA` | Skin being used by the AVD, e.g. `WQVGA432` or `480x800` |
| `ANDROID_ADB_SERVER_PORT` | `51292` | Port that the AVD server for this build is running on (random for each build) |
| `ANDROID_TMP_LOGCAT_FILE` | `/var/tmp/logcat_943239.log` | Temporary file to which logcat output is written during the build (random for each build) |
| `JENKINS_ANDROID_HOME` | `/home/jenkins/tools/android-sdk` | The path to the Android SDK being used for this build (optional) |
| `ANDROID_HOME` | `/home/jenkins/tools/android-sdk` | The path to the Android SDK being used for this build (optional) |

### Using the emulator [using the emulator permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-using-the-emulator)

Now that you have an Android emulator running, you'll probably want to install one or more Android applications (APKs) and start running some tests.

Basically, whenever you want to call `adb` as part of your build, just call it as you normally would, e.g. `adb install my-app.apk`.

If you're using Android's default Ant build system, you should specify the `sdk.dir` property, to tell Ant it can find the Android build scripts:

Just add " `sdk.dir=$ANDROID_HOME`" to the "Properties" field of your "Invoke Ant" build step.

Documentation for older plugin versions...

#### Using version 1.18 or older... [using version 118 or older permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-using-version-118-or-older)

Normally, when running an Android application using Eclipse or the command line, either your APK is automatically installed (because there is only one emulator/device attached to your PC), or Eclipse allows you to choose from a list. Similarly, when building from the command line, installation is done with a command like: " `adb -e install -r my-app.apk`", where " `-e`" specifies the emulator (or " `-d`" a USB-attached device).

However, as Jenkins may be running multiple Android-related builds at once, with several emulators running in parallel, it's not possible to automatically determine which emulator should be used. Nor can the user be prompted at build time.

Since version 1.15, the `ANDROID_SERIAL` environment variable has been automatically set by the plugin. Because the `adb` tool automatically uses this variable to determine which Android device to communicate with, you no longer need to pass in parameters like " `-s`" or " `-e`" to `adb`.

Furthermore, since version 2.13, if the plugin detects (or automatically installs) your Android SDK, the SDK tools and platform tools directories will be prepended to your `$PATH` during a build. This means you don't have to supply the full path to tools like `adb` or `monkeyrunner`, even if those tools would not normally be on the `$PATH`.

#### Using version 1.14 or older... [using version 114 or older permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-using-version-114-or-older)

##### Working with Android's default Ant build system [working with androids default ant build system permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-working-with-androids-default-ant-build-system)

The default build system for Android is Apache Ant, which is well supported by Jenkins.

When calling targets like " `ant install`" or " `ant run-tests`", the Android build system allows you to use the `adb.device.arg` property to specify where the application should be installed to.

To make use of this in an "Invoke Ant" build step, just add the following to your Ant "Properties" section:

`adb.device.arg="-s $ANDROID_AVD_DEVICE"`

##### Using shell commands [using shell commands permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-using-shell-commands)

If you aren't using Ant, but want Jenkins to run `adb` commands for you via an "Execute shell" build step, the process is similar.

To install, use the `ANDROID_AVD_DEVICE` environment variable with the `-s` flag:

`adb -s $ANDROID_AVD_DEVICE install -r my-app.apk`

This would be automatically expanded by the shell to something like:

`adb -s localhost:34564 install -r my-app.apk`

The same principle applies for any other `adb` commands you wish to perform, for example to start running tests:

`adb -s $ANDROID_AVD_DEVICE shell am instrument -r -w com.example.tests/android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner | tee test-result.txt`

#### Installing project prerequisites [installing project prerequisites permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-installing-project-prerequisites)

When compiling an Android project, you must have all the prerequisite Android platform images installed. For example, if you have an Android app which relies on an Android library project, plus you have a unit test project — these may all be targeting different Android SDK versions, all of which must be present at compile time.

Normally, with the (deprecated) Ant build system, these target versions are specified in either a " `project.properties`" or " `default.properties`" file.

Since version 2.1, the plugin provides a " **Install Android project prerequisites**" build step for the Ant build system, which automatically detects the target versions in the build workspace, then automatically installs any of the corresponding Android platform images that are not yet installed.

This build step requires no configuration — just add it before the build step that compiles your Android projects.

For the Gradle build system, I would recommend including the [Android SDK Manager Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin) in your project. You may have to use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/) to get the latest version.

#### Creating project build files [creating project build files permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-creating-project-build-files)

If you only build a project in Eclipse or using another IDE, you may not have the required Ant build files created or checked into your repository.

Since version 2.8, the " **Create Android build files**" build step will automatically find any Android app, library or test projects in a build's workspace and will create the build files for them, using the appropriate " `android update project`" command.

#### Installing and uninstalling APKs [installing and uninstalling apks permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-installing-and-uninstalling-apks)

Since version 1.9, the plugin can automatically install an APK on the started emulator for you.

Under the "Build" section of your job configuration, select "Add build step" and choose " **Install Android package**".

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_install-package.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_install-package.png)

In the "APK file" field that appears, enter the filename of the APK you wish to install. When a build runs, the APK will be automatically installed after the emulator has started up.

Note: It is also possible to use this build step without having started an emulator via this plugin — you can install an APK on an attached device or other emulator.

#### Running the Android `monkey` tool [running the android monkey tool permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-running-the-android-monkey-tool)

The plugin provides a Build Step called " **Run Android monkey tester**" which will run the [monkey](https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/monkey.html) stress-testing tool against the given Android package.

The output is saved to a file — by default " `monkey.txt`" in the root of the build workspace.

Don't forget to archive this file by using "Archive the artifacts" option under "Post-build Actions" if you want to keep the monkey output for future reference!

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_monkey-run.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_monkey-run.png)

#### Parsing `monkey` output [parsing monkey output permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-parsing-monkey-output)

Also provided is a method of parsing the output of the monkey testing tool.

Under the "Post-build Actions" section, enable the " **Publish Android monkey tester result**". No further configuration is required — by default the plugin will search for " `monkey.txt`" in the root of the build workspace, parse the file's contents and display the result on the build page.

If the monkey output reveals your Android application crashed or caused an "Application Not Responding" situation, the build will be marked as UNSTABLE.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_monkey-publish.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_monkey-publish.png)

You can, of course, specify a different filename (including the use of variables) or change the "Set build result" option to mark the build as a FAILURE rather than just UNSTABLE, or leave its status untouched in case the monkey information does not indicate success.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_monkey-result.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_monkey-result.png)

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin@master/docs/images/android_artifacts.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/android-emulator-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/android_artifacts.png)

### Artifacts [artifacts permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-artifacts)

Once the emulator is ready for use, its log is captured until the build finishes. This corresponds to the output of " `adb logcat -v time`", i.e. the main log output including timestamps.

This will be archived automatically as a build artifact, with the name `logcat.txt`.

## Known issues [known issues permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-known-issues)

View known issues...

### Pipeline not yet supported [pipeline not yet supported permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-pipeline-not-yet-supported)

This plugin is currently still only compatible with Freestyle jobs — Pipeline support is planned!

### Emulator v2 [emulator v2 permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-emulator-v2)

The new-and-improved emulator engine — first released as part of SDK Tools 25 (and Android Studio 2.0) — is supported as of version 3.0 of this plugin.

However, the Quick Boot feature (formerly known as snapshots) is currently not supported, as the command line tools do not appear to support this.

### Android SDK Tools [android sdk tools permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-android-sdk-tools)

Due to a regression in SDK Tools r12 and r13 (see [Android bug #18444](http://b.android.com/18444)), running any builds with the "Use emulator snapshots" option enabled (which is the default), would likely fail to load in the state you expect. For example the emulator may not be ready for use, and the screen may not be unlocked.

To avoid this, either keep using r11 or earlier, or update to r14 or newer. However, if you update, you will have to manually delete all existing snapshot images and allow this plugin to re-create them.

See the [Known Issues](http://tools.android.com/knownissues) page on the Android Tools site for more information.

Similarly, snapshot support does not fully function for Android 4.0 until SDK Tools r15. An initial snapshot can be created, but subsequently loading from that snapshot will crash the emulator immediately. Earlier Android versions are not affected, i.e. you can still use snapshots with Android 3.2 and earlier. Upgrading to SDK Tools r15+ should fix this.

As a workaround, you can also uncheck "Use emulator snapshots" in any jobs where you are seeing problems.

### Running in a Windows service as "Local System" [running in a windows service as local system permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-running-in-a-windows-service-as-local-system)

New AVDs cannot be generated and run if Jenkins is running as a Windows service, using the "Local System" account (see [JENKINS-7355](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-7355)).

- Workaround: configure the Jenkins service to "run as" a real user

### Emulator UI doesn't appear when running on Windows 7 [emulator ui doesnt appear when running on windows 7 permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-emulator-ui-doesnt-appear-when-running-on-windows-7)

If running Jenkins as a service on Windows 7 or newer, you may find that while the plugin can start an emulator, its user interface may not appear, even if configured to do so.

This is due to something called Session 0 Isolation, which prevents services from starting UIs for security reasons.

If you really need to see the emulator UI, you can either run Jenkins not as a service, or add an agent node to Jenkins (e.g. launch agent via JNLP on the same machine) which will bypass this isolation.

### Unexpected timeouts or hanging during build [unexpected timeouts or hanging during build permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-unexpected-timeouts-or-hanging-during-build)

AVDs can, on occasion, time-out unexpectedly or stop responding during a build, e.g. when trying to install an APK (see [JENKINS-7354](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-7354)).

- This is generally caused by bugs in the ADB process. It can be prone to hanging or crashing. Over time, more safeguards have been added to the plugin, including timing-out after a while and isolating ADB instances, so this shouldn't happen too often.

This should also be more stable with version 3.0 of this plugin, which allows the new emulator engine to be used.

### AVDs may not shut down fully at the end of a build [avds may not shut down fully at the end of a build permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-avds-may-not-shut-down-fully-at-the-end-of-a-build)

Sometimes the `emulator` process does not shut down fully at the end of a build (requiring a `kill -9` on Linux); the plugin sends a [console command to terminate the emulator](https://developer.android.com/guide/developing/devices/emulator.html#terminating) and the UI window closes, but the actual `emulator` process does not die.

- This issue will be fixed once [JENKINS-11995](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-11995) is implemented.
- If your agent is running Linux, you may be running into [Android issue #17294](http://b.android.com/17294)

In this case, there is a workaround assuming your build doesn't need to use the emulator's audio input:

  - Add a custom hardware property called " `hw.audioInput`" with the value " `no`"

## Potential upcoming features [potential upcoming features permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/android-emulator/\#plugin-content-potential-upcoming-features)

_Important!_

Newesth version is compatibility with the previous version priour 2.0.12 is maintained. However, major changes have been made to the handling of macOS keychains.

Information to access the keychain is moved from configuration to credentials.

After that, the information for accessing the keychain must be registered in the credentials.

This plugin adds the ability to call Xcode command line tools to automate build and packaging iOS applications (iPhone, iPad, ...).

#### Features [features permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-features)

##### Versioning [versioning permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-versioning)

This builder can invoke agvtool to dynamically update the `CFBundleVersion` (a.k.a. Technical Version) or `CFBundleShortVersionString` (a.k.a. Marketing Version). It supports all macros from the . For example the value `${BUILD_NUMBER`} will be replaced with the current build number. We advice you to generate a unique value for each build for the `CFBundleVersion` if you want for example deploy it into a private store. In that case you can use for example : `${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER`}

##### Building [building permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-building)

The target (optional), configuration (e.g. `Debug`, `Release`) and SDK (optional) can be specified in the per-project config along with whether to perform a clean before the build phase.

##### Packaging [packaging permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-packaging)

The builder can be used to package the .app into a .ipa. Since a .app is actually a directory, it can be awkward to work with and, especially, distribute. We can simplify this by packaging the .app into a single .ipa file, which is just a

zip file with a well-known internal structure

##### Signing [signing permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-signing)

This plugin has two features that help you simplify the code signing process.

###### Allowing Jenkins to stage developer profile [allowing jenkins to stage developer profile permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-allowing-jenkins-to-stage-developer-profile)

This plugin builds on top of to allow you to store your Apple Developer Profile (\*.developerprofile) file. [This file contains a code signing private key, corresponding developer/distribution certificates, and mobile provisioning profiles](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15154211/what-data-are-stored-in-developer-profile-file-exported-from-xcode). You can [create this file from your XCode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10404931/copying-keys-and-certificates-to-another-one-mac-for-iphone-development).

To upload the developer profile into Jenkins, go to "Manage Credentials" in the system configuration page, and select "Apple Developer Profile" from the "Add" button. See for further details.

To use this profile for signing, add "Import developer profile" as a build step before you run xcode, and select the developer profile to import into the build machine. This build step will install the developer profile into the slave's keychain.

###### Work with existing populated keychains [work with existing populated keychains permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-work-with-existing-populated-keychains)

If you create a dedicated keychain that stores the code signing private key and certificate on every build slave, you can configure the plugin to just unlock this keychain (so that xcode can use it for signing)

Unlocking

If you store your keys in the user keychain (most probably) and if you run jenkins as daemon, make sure you installed a recent version of jenkins for Mac, or configured the daemon to create a session (through the CreationSession=true parameter in your org.jenkins-ci.plist daemon config file). [See also](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9626447/unable-to-sign-ios-builds-with-jenkins)

Timeouts

The keychain has a default timeout of 300 seconds. One can override it using the security set-keychain-settings command, which isn't supported in the plugin today. Support in the plugin could be improved by adding options to modify the timeout as part of the build process. See [JENKINS-17184](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-17184).

##### Unit Testing [unit testing permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-unit-testing)

This plugin will listen to the xcodebuild output when running OCUnit or XC tests and write out JUnit-format test reports that Jenkins can understand. Jenkins will then use these to publish test failure reports and graphs.

#### Documentation [documentation permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-documentation)

##### Installation guide [installation guide permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-installation-guide)

Obviously, the build machine has to be an OSX machine with XCode developer tools installed.

Certificates, Identities and Provisions must be installed on the build machine separately.

Just install the latest version of the plugin from the update center and configure a freestyle job (see #Usage Guide) that will use your OSX node (If your central instance isn't running under OSX).

If xcode related binaries aren't stored in the default location, update the global configuration of the plugin (Manage Jenkins -> Configure System)

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/xcode-plugin@master/docs/images/46781a5731ff4fb8b72f4d780b2b02a402f34a2e.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/xcode-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/46781a5731ff4fb8b72f4d780b2b02a402f34a2e.png)

If you want to use multiple versions of Xcode to build your application, use ’Global Tool Configuration’ to register the distinguished name and location of the installed Xcode. [![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/xcode-plugin@master/docs/images/f3e88bf4404d395d55e82786142b77ee217ddbd1.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/xcode-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/f3e88bf4404d395d55e82786142b77ee217ddbd1.png)

##### Usage guide [usage guide permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-usage-guide)

###### Import developer profile step [import developer profile step permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-import-developer-profile-step)

By adding the Import developer profile step to Build, you can import developer profiles exported to Xcode into temporary keychains or existing keychains.

The developer profile contains a set of certificates, secret keys and provisioning profiles necessary for compiling and signing applications, which is useful for distributing with multiple Jenkins nodes.

###### Import developer profile configuration parameters [import developer profile configuration parameters permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-import-developer-profile-configuration-parameters)

| Parameter | Pipeline Parameter | Since version | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Developer Profile | profileId | 2.0.1 | Select the developer profile you exported from Xcode Preference to import into the keychain. Developer profile must be registered with Jenkins in advance by "Credentials". If you do not select this column, you can specify the identifier of the developer profile registered in "Credentials" with the next "Developer Profile ID". |
| Import into existing Keychain | importIntoExistingKeychain | 2.0.6 | If it is checked, the developer profile will be imported into the existing keychain. If not checked, create a new key chain with the file name "jenkins-" + "job name" newly, and import the developer profile into this. (In this case, a random character string is automatically generated and used for the password) |
| Target keychain | keychainId | 2.0.13 | The ID of the configured keychain to use to import certificates from developer profile to sign the package. |
| Target keychain | keychainName<br>This has been deprecated and has now been replaced by "keychainId". | 2.0.6 | The name of the configured keychain to use to import certificates from developer profile to sign the package. |
| Keychain path | keychainPath | 2.0.6 | Keychain path to import developer profile. |
| Keychain password | keychainPwd | 2.0.6 | Password to unlock keychain importing developer profile. |

Limitations

The Xcode Integration Plugin has the function of importing the secret key and certificate of the developer account into the temporary key chain, but as the constraint of macOS can not handle different key chain for each session, the job handling the key chain If you execute them in parallel, this will not work properly.

As one of workarounds, it is impossible to limit the maximum number of jobs around Jenkins' node to 1 and to execute multiple nodes with different macOS accounts.

###### Setting up a build step [setting up a build step permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-setting-up-a-build-step)

Add the XCode build step to a free-style project and set the target (e.g. `MyApp`), configuration (e.g. `Release`) and check the build IPA and update version number options. This will give you a single, versioned .ipa file. You can also select to clean the project before a build; while this will make sure that the project is starting from a clean state, it will make large projects take a lot longer.

###### Setting up a unit test step [setting up a unit test step permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-setting-up-a-unit-test-step)

Add the XCode build step and this time specify your unit test target (e.g. `MyAppTests`), configuration (e.g. `Debug`) and the SDK (e.g. `Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator4.1.sdk/`).

Leave all the checkboxes unselected. The SDK needs to be supplied here as the unit tests will only be run when building under the simulator's SDK.

Check the "Publish JUnit test result report" option in the project config and set the value ```"*``/test-reports/``*.xml"``` under "Test report XMLs". This will tell Jenkins to pick up the JUnit-format test reports.

| Custom xcodebuild arguments | xcodebuildArguments | 1.3 | Passing custom arguments is convenient when you need to change some project options for Jenkins build, but don't want them to persist in project file. For example when running application tests, following settings often are nice fit: GCC\_SYMBOLS\_PRIVATE\_EXTERN=NO COPY\_PHASE\_STRIP=NO. Otherwise Release build will usually fail because it won't be able to find application symbols to link with test bundle. Arguments are currently separated by space, enclosing them in quotes won't help. |

| Build output directory | buildDir | 1.2 | The value to use for CONFIGURATION\_BUILD\_DIR setting (BUILD\_DIR in >= 2.0.0). You only need to supply this value if you want the product of the XCode build to be in a location other than the one specified in project settings and this job 'SYMROOT' parameter. Supports all macros and also environment and build variables from the Token Macro Plugin. For example you can use the value : ${WORKSPACE}/build |
| Asset pack URL | assetPackManifestURL | 2.0.3 | Export settings for non-App Store App.<br>If the application is using on-demand resources and the application will installing OTA with manifest.plist, this must be the base URL that specifies the host of the asset pack. This will set up the app to download the asset pack from the specified URL. |
| Application URL | appURL | 2.0.3 | Specify the URL for installing the application when creating the manifest.plist that is necessary when OTA installing the application from Web pages or email. |
| Allow failing build results? | allowFailingBuildResults | 1.4 | Checking this option will prevent this build step from failing if xcodebuild exits with a non-zero return code. |
| .ipa filename pattern | ipaName | 1.4 | A pattern for the ipa file name. You may use ${VERSION} and ${BUILD\_DATE} (yyyy.MM.dd) in this string |

###### Setting up a Export IPA step [setting up a export ipa step permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-setting-up-a-export-ipa-step)

> When using "XCode's" Automatically manage signing ", various ways are required, so please note the points to be noted separately.

##### Using multiple versions of xcode. [using multiple versions of xcode permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-using-multiple-versions-of-xcode)

One can easily support multiple versions by using environment variables. But first one need to install multiple versions on the build server. Here's one strategy:

###### install multiple versions of xcode [install multiple versions of xcode permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-install-multiple-versions-of-xcode)

0\. Note current config.

xcode-select -p

1\. download xcode DMGs from [http://developer.apple.com/downloads/](http://developer.apple.com/downloads/)

2\. enable install from everywhere (under System preferences / Security)

Without that I had problems installing xcode, without graphical feedback, tested on 10.9.5, freshly booted.

Symptoms were:

- app not responsive
- Getting errors like in /var/log/system.log

Someone attempted to start application App:"Xcode" asn:0x0-1b62b61 pid:57656 refs=6 @ 0x7fa5d9f6df40 but it still has \_kLSApplicationLockedInStoppedStateKey=true, so it is is staying stopped. : LASApplication.cp #2468 SetApplicationInStoppedState() q=LSSession 100027/0x186bb queue

3\. open DMG file, copy app to /Applications. This might take a while.

4\. close /Volumes/Xcode (otherwise installation won't start)

5\. start Xcode, accept agreement, install missing packages if necessary. This might take a while. Close xcode after GUI opens.

6\. move freshly installed Xcode to new path, e.g.

sudo mv /Applications/Xcode.app /Applications/Xcode6.1.app

(I use this so that the xcode app appears with version number under spotlight)

7\. reset default xcode-select if necessary (installation might have changed it / reset to /Applications/Xcode.app)

sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode6.1.app

(Note the part above could be fully automated....)

###### Select the xcode version at runtime [select the xcode version at runtime permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-select-the-xcode-version-at-runtime)

1\. Use EnvInject plugin

2\. for jobs that require the non default do something like

DEVELOPER\_DIR=/Applications/Xcode6.0.1.app/Contents/Developer

under Inject environment variables to the build process

###### Select the xcode version at runtime (Version 2.0.3 or later) [select the xcode version at runtime version 203 or later permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-select-the-xcode-version-at-runtime-version-203-or-later)

1. Register the distinguished name and location of the installed Xcode using ’Global Tool Configuration’.
2. Select Xcode registered in 'Global Tool Configuration' in Job's 'Xcode Tools Version'.

That's it.

#### FAQ [faq permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-faq)

##### User interaction is not allowed [user interaction is not allowed permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-user-interaction-is-not-allowed)

When code-signing, a prompt may appear on the build machine asking whether to allow keychain access.

This will block the build with a message like `"User interaction is not allowed"` until it is dismissed.

Just select 'Always Allow' the first time and it shouldn't need to ask again.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/xcode-plugin@master/docs/images/308d472628999c9f1961068c9af34e49a31c76c7.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/xcode-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/308d472628999c9f1961068c9af34e49a31c76c7.png)

If this prompt is not showing on the build machine, you can force it to appear by running the codesign command that failed from a terminal on the build machine: /usr/bin/codesign --force --sign "iPhone Distribution: .....

##### No Xcode folder is set [no xcode folder is set permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-no-xcode-folder-is-set)

\[sources\] $ /usr/bin/xcodebuild -version xcode-select: Error: No Xcode folder is set. Run xcode-select -switch <xcode\_folder\_path> to set the path to the Xcode folder. Error: /usr/bin/xcode-select returned unexpected error. FATAL: Check your XCode installation. Jenkins cannot retrieve its version.

You probably just installed XCode (by default it is in `/Developer`) but its path isn't configured. You can fix it with

xcode-select -switch /Developer/

You should now be able to execute `xcodebuild`. Ex :

host:~ user$ /usr/bin/xcodebuild -version Xcode 4.2 Build version 4C199

##### Xcode 4.3 [xcode 43 permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xcode-plugin/\#plugin-content-xcode-43)

XCode 4.3 changes [2 things](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_4_3.html) that are important for our usage on a slave or a master :

- **Command-Line Tools Are Optional** : The command-line tools are not bundled with Xcode 4.3 by default. Instead, they have to be installed using the Components tab of the Downloads preferences panel [![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/xcode-plugin@master/docs/images/8f2803dc1d2d272296cfa2ba044a3286e29a374c.jpg)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/xcode-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/8f2803dc1d2d272296cfa2ba044a3286e29a374c.jpg)

- **/Developer No Longer Exists** : You may have to reconfigure its path like this:

sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/

## Description [description permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-description)

This plugin adds [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) Support to Jenkins. [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) is managed as another tool inside Jenkins (the same way as Ant or Maven), including support for automatic installation and a new build step is provided to execute Gradle tasks.

It also detects any [Develocity](https://gradle.com/build-scans/) Build Scan publications to provide an enhanced job summary for each Gradle or Maven build invocation that occurred during the job.

You can have the [Develocity Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/) and the [Develocity Maven extension](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/) automatically injected into your Gradle and Maven builds. See [Develocity integration](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/#plugin-content-develocity-integration) for more details.

## Configuration [configuration permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-configuration)

Gradle configuration is performed in the **Configure System** (before Jenkins 2.0) or **Global Tool Configuration** (starting in Jenkins 2.0). In both cases these options reside in the **Manage Jenkins** section.

In the **Gradle** section provided by this plugin, several installations can be configured:

[![Tool installations](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/gradle-tool-installation.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/gradle-tool-installation.png)

The system provides both automatic installation, which can be performed by directly downloading a Gradle distribution from the [Gradle website](http://www.gradle.org/) or executing some shell commands to achieve the same. Besides, for nodes which already have Gradle installed, the tool can be manually configured, by unchecking the **Install automatically** checkbox and providing the base path (as a `GRADLE_HOME` environment variable) of the installation.

## Usage [usage permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-usage)

The Gradle plugin provides an **Invoke Gradle script** build step.

[![Build step](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/gradle-build-step.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/gradle-build-step.png)

The first configuration option is whether to use one of the installation configured in Jenkins (see previous section) of use the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) which is the Gradle-provided mechanism to "embed" the use of a specific Gradle version in a build, installing it if necessary.

Other configuration options include:

- A description to use for the build step.

- Switches (options) to provide to the Gradle execution.

- Tasks to execute (if blank the defaults tasks of the build will be invoked).

- Path to the build script if different from the root directory of the build.

- Name of the build script if different from `build.gradle`.


If a [Gradle Build Scan](https://gradle.com/build-scans/) is produced during a build, then a link to it is added to the build page.

[![Build Scan link](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/jenkins-build-scan.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/jenkins-build-scan.png)

## Capturing build scans from the console log [capturing build scans from the console log permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-capturing-build-scans-from-the-console-log)

If you are not using the Gradle build step described above, or have a Maven build, you can configure to detect published [build scans](https://gradle.com/build-scans/) from the console log. For doing so, go to **Build Environment** and check **Inspect build log for published build scans**.

[![Inspect build log for Build Scan](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/inspect-logs-for-build-scans.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/inspect-logs-for-build-scans.png)

If build scans are detected in the console log of a build, a badge will be added to the build page. This works for [build scans](https://gradle.com/build-scans/) produced by Gradle and Maven builds.

[![Build Scan link](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/jenkins-build-scan.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/jenkins-build-scan.png)

## Capturing build scans from Jenkins Pipeline [capturing build scans from jenkins pipeline permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-capturing-build-scans-from-jenkins-pipeline)

When using Jenkins pipeline, there is the build step wrapper `withGradle` which can be used to find the build scans emitted by Gradle or Maven builds and show them on the build page. In order to do so, wrap your `sh` or `bat` steps which invoke Gradle or Maven into `withGradle`.

For example:

```
node {
  withGradle {
    sh './gradlew build'
  }
}
```

This causes the shell output to be highlighted and build scan links, which are published, are captured. The captured build scan links are then shown on the build page and in the pipeline steps view.

[![Build scan in pipeline view](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/pipeline-steps-scan.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/pipeline-steps-scan.png)

There is also the `findBuildScans()` step, which finds the build scans in the complete log of the pipeline job. The `withGradle` wrapper should be used instead, since it also deals well with parallel output.

[![Find build scans](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/find-build-scans.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/find-build-scans.png)

## Enriched build scans [enriched build scans permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-enriched-build-scans)

Build scans links on the Job summary page can be enriched with data fetched from the [Develocity server API](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/api-manual/). If enabled, the project name, requested tasks, build tool version, build outcome and build scan links will be provided. This feature is available for both Gradle and Maven builds and compatible with auto-injection documented below.

[![Enriched build scans](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/enriched-build-scans.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/enriched-build-scans.png)

> **Note** \- Build scans published on the public instance ( [https://scans.gradle.com](https://scans.gradle.com/)) are not eligible.

> **Note** \- Enabling this feature will trigger 2 HTTP requests to the Develocity server per build scan published.

### Enriched build scans configuration [enriched build scans configuration permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-enriched-build-scans-configuration)

The configuration of the feature can be done in the Jenkins global system configuration.

The feature can be enabled or disabled (default).

If anonymous access to the API is not allowed, an access key has to be provided.

HTTP client settings can also be customized.

[![Enriched build scans configuration](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/enriched-build-scans-configuration.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/enriched-build-scans-configuration.png)

## Develocity integration [develocity integration permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-develocity-integration)

The plugin can be configured to inject the [Develocity Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/) or the [Develocity Maven extension](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/) into any Gradle or Maven build that is executed on the Jenkins server or on any of its connected agents. To achieve this, the plugin installs various files on each agent depending on the configuration via the global options in the `Manage Jenkins/Configure System` section.

The same auto-injection behavior is available for the [Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin) and the [Common Custom User Data Maven extension](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension).

> **Note** \- The configuration applies to all builds on all connected agents matching the specified label criteria, or all in case no label criteria are defined.

### Enable auto-injection [enable auto injection permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-enable-auto-injection)

The auto-injection is split into several levels to have fine-grained control over the enablement of this feature.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Important | Develocity `2024.1` or above is required starting from version `2.12` and above. See [Short-lived access tokens](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/#plugin-content-_short_lived_access_tokens) for more infos. |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Important | Starting from plugin version `2.13`, the Maven extension is not bundled with the Jenkins Gradle plugin and requires an explicit version configuration to be injected. When upgrading from an earlier version, the injection will be turned off until the version is configured. |

#### Global [global permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-global)

To globally enable the auto-injection, click the `Enable auto-injection` checkbox in the `Develocity integration` section of the global options in the `Manage Jenkins/Configure System` section. Next set the URL of the Develocity instance to which the build scans should be published to.

[![Enable auto-injection](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/enable-auto-injection.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/enable-auto-injection.png)

Optionally you can click the `Enforce Develocity server url` checkbox to enforce the configured Develocity URL over a URL configured in the project’s build (only applies to Gradle projects).

##### VCS repository filtering (Beta) [vcs repository filtering beta permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-vcs-repository-filtering-beta)

It is also possible to enable/disable injection for specific repositories by specifying VCS repository filters. These are _Newline-delimited_ set of rules in the form of `+|-:repository_matching_keyword`, which will be used in a contains check against the repository URL.

[![Git VCS repository filters](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/general-vcs-repository-filters.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/general-vcs-repository-filters.png)

Consider the following examples:

```
+:foo
```

The injection will only be performed for Git repository URLs which contain `foo`.

```
-:foo
```

The injection will not be performed for Git repository URLs which contain `foo`, but will be for all others.

```
+:foo
-:foobar
```

The injection will be performed for Git repository URLs which contain `foo`, but not the ones containing `foobar`.

The exclusion patterns take precedence over the inclusion patterns.

> **Note** \- This feature is currently in Beta and requires Git Plugin to be installed. If Git Plugin is not installed, the following warning message will be show instead. The feature supports both Gradle and Maven builds (FreeStyle and Pipeline job configurations)

[![Git Plugin is not installed](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/general-git-plugin-not-installed.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/general-git-plugin-not-installed.png)

#### Gradle [gradle permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-gradle)

To enable the auto-injection for Gradle builds, set the desired [Develocity Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/) version in the `Develocity Gradle plugin version` field in the `Gradle settings` section of the configuration form.

[![Gradle settings](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/gradle-settings.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/gradle-settings.png)

Optionally set the desired version of the [Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin) to be used.

#### Maven [maven permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-maven)

To enable the auto-injection for Maven builds, set the desired [Develocity Maven extension](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/maven-extension/) version in the `Develocity Maven extension version` field in the `Maven settings` section of the configuration form.

[![Maven settings](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin@master/plugin/images/maven-settings.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/blob/master/plugin/images/maven-settings.png)

Optionally set the desired version of the [Common Custom User Data Maven Extension](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-maven-extension) to be used.

To see which versions are injected, refer to [Auto-injection compatibility](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/#plugin-content-auto-injection-compatibility).

> **Warning** \- Maven injection only works if `MAVEN_OPTS` is not configured as a global environment variable.

### Disable auto-injection [disable auto injection permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-disable-auto-injection)

Disabling the auto-injection requires that all Develocity resources are cleaned up from the agents. To achieve this, the Gradle or Maven injections must be disabled individually (see the following sections). This triggers a cleanup of the resources. If the auto-injection should be disabled globally, then uncheck the `Enable auto-injection` checkbox as well.

#### Gradle [gradle 1 permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-gradle-1)

To disable the auto-injection for Gradle builds, remove the `Develocity Gradle plugin version` in the `Gradle settings` section of the configuration form.

#### Maven [maven 1 permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-maven-1)

To disable the auto-injection for Maven builds, remove the `Develocity Maven extension version` in the `Maven settings` section of the configuration form.

### Control auto-injection based on node labels [control auto injection based on node labels permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-control-auto-injection-based-on-node-labels)

Auto-injection can be enabled or disabled based on specific node labels. To enable auto-injection only on specific nodes, add the desired labels to the `Gradle auto-injection enabled nodes` list for Gradle or `Maven auto-injection enabled nodes` for Maven. To disable auto-injection on specific nodes, add the desired labels to the `Gradle auto-injection disabled nodes` list for Gradle or `Maven auto-injection disabled nodes` for Maven.

The disabled labels list will take precedence over the enabled labels list.

### Configuration options [configuration options permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-configuration-options)

The following sections list all available configuration options which can be set via the configuration form.

#### Common configuration options [common configuration options permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-common-configuration-options)

`Enable auto-injection`

Globally enable auto-injection.

`Develocity server url`

The URL of the Develocity instance.

`Allow untrusted server`

Whether to allow publishing to a server with a self-signed certificate.

`Develocity Access Key credential ID`

The credential ID of the access key for authenticating with the Develocity server. During the job execution, the access key is used to get a short-lived token from the Develocity server.

#### Short-lived access tokens [short lived access tokens permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-short-lived-access-tokens)

Develocity access keys are long-lived, creating risks if they are leaked. To avoid this, users can use short-lived access tokens to authenticate with Develocity. Access tokens can be used wherever an access key would be used. Access tokens are only valid for the Develocity instance that created them. If a short-lived token fails to be retrieved (for example, if the Develocity server version is lower than `2024.1`), no access key will be set. In that case, Develocity authenticated operations like build cache read/write and build scan publication will fail without failing the build. For more information on short-lived tokens, see [Develocity API documentation](https://docs.gradle.com/develocity/api-manual/#short_lived_access_tokens).

#### Gradle specific configuration options [gradle specific configuration options permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-gradle-specific-configuration-options)

`Develocity Gradle plugin version`

Enables auto-injection for Gradle builds and defines which version of the [Develocity Gradle plugin](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/gradle-plugin/) to use.

`Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin version`

Defines which version of the [Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin) to use.

`Gradle plugin repository url`

The URL of the repository to use to resolve the Develocity Gradle plugin and the Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin. This is required if the Jenkins agents are not able to access the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/).

`Gradle plugin repository credential ID`

The credentials containing username and password for a custom Gradle Plugin repository.

`Gradle auto-injection enabled nodes`

A list of node labels on which the Develocity Gradle plugin or Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin injection should be enabled. By default, all nodes are enabled.

`Gradle auto-injection disabled nodes`

### Auto-injection compatibility [auto injection compatibility permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-auto-injection-compatibility)

The following sections list the compatibility of the plugin with the Develocity version based on the given build tool in use.

#### For Gradle builds [for gradle builds permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-for-gradle-builds)

For Gradle builds the version used for the Develocity Gradle plugin is defined in the `Develocity Gradle plugin version` field in the `Gradle settings` section of the configuration form. See [Enable auto-injection](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/#plugin-content-enable-auto-injection) for details. The compatibility of the specified version with Develocity can be found [here](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/compatibility/#gradle_enterprise_gradle_plugin).

For the optional Common Custom User Data Gradle plugin which is defined the same form, you can see the compatibility of the specified version with the Develocity Gradle plugin [here](https://github.com/gradle/common-custom-user-data-gradle-plugin#version-compatibility).

#### For Maven builds [for maven builds permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-for-maven-builds)

For Maven builds the version used for the Develocity Maven extension is defined in the `Develocity Maven extension version` field in the `Maven settings` section of the configuration form. See [Enable auto-injection](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/#plugin-content-enable-auto-injection) for details. The compatibility of the specified version with Develocity can be found [here](https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/compatibility/#maven_extension).

For plugin version older that `2.13`, the Maven extension is bundled with the plugin and does not require a version configuration. Please refer to [this](https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-plugin/tree/gradle-2.12.1?tab=readme-ov-file#for-maven-builds) README version for a compatibility matrix.

## Disabling/uninstalling Gradle Jenkins plugin [disablinguninstalling gradle jenkins plugin permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-disablinguninstalling-gradle-jenkins-plugin)

To ensure that all Develocity resources are cleaned up from the agents, before disabling/uninstalling the plugin the auto-injection has to be manually disabled. Please, refer to the [Disable auto-injection](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/#plugin-content-disable-auto-injection) section for details.

## Upgrade notes [upgrade notes permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-upgrade-notes)

### 2.0 [20 permalink](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gradle/\#plugin-content-20)

> **Note** \- These upgrade notes only apply if you configured the Develocity auto-injection feature.

A new form based configuration was introduced in this version, which replaces the configuration via environment variables. There is no automatic migration, therefore you need to manually migrate the already configured auto-injection via environment variables you’d need to follow these steps:

1. Copy the values of the following environment variables and then remove them in the global configuration following environment variables from the global configuration:



- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_INJECTION`

- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_URL`

- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_SERVER`

- `GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_ACCESS_KEY`

- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_GRADLE_ENTERPRISE_PLUGIN_VERSION`

- `JENKINSGRADLEPLUGIN_CCUD_PLUGIN_VERSION`
